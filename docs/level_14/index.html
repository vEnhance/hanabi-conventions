title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><ul><li>If a clue could be given by multiple players, who should give the clue? If some players have known-playable cards and other players have nothing to do, then it makes the most sense to leave the clue for the players who have nothing to do.</li><li>If someone gives a clue with a globally-known playable card in their hand and forces the next player to have nothing to do, this is bad teamwork - unless there was a reason!</li><li>When this occurs, the clue should do one &quot;extra&quot; thing:<ul><li>If the clue would normally be interpreted as a <em>Save Clue</em>, then it transforms into an <em>Occupied Play Clue</em>.</li><li>If the clue would normally be interpreted as a <em>Play Clue</em> or a <em>Prompt</em>, then it transforms into an <em>Occupied Finesse</em>.</li></ul></li><li>Note that the concept of being <em>Occupied</em> generalizes to lots of different kind of moves. For example, when an <em>Occupied</em> player clues an off-chop 5, it is certainly not a <em>5 Stall</em> - it must be an <em>Occupied 5 Pull</em>!</li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="the-trash-push"></a>The Trash Push<a class="hash-link" href="#the-trash-push" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><ul><li>Normally, when a useless card is clued, it signifies a <em>Trash Chop Move</em>. However, what if the useless card is actually the card on chop? Then it wouldn&#x27;t be <em>Chop Moving</em> anything.</li><li>From <em>Good Touch Principle</em>, we know that it is pointless to spend a clue to touch a useless card on someone&#x27;s chop, because if we just do nothing, the useless card will get automatically discarded.</li><li>Subsequently, if this is done deliberately, it must have a meaning. By doing this, it means that we want to &quot;push&quot; the card that is next to the useless card onto the table.</li><li>For example, in a 3-player game:<ul><li>All of the 1&#x27;s are played on the stacks.</li><li>Bob has no clued cards in his hand. His chop is his slot 5.</li><li>Alice clues Bob number 1, which only touches his slot 5 card.</li><li>Bob blind-plays his slot 4 card, and it is a playable red 2.</li></ul></li><li>Sometimes, a <em>Trash Push</em> is the only way to get a card played that is sitting between two other annoying cards.</li><li>Similar to a <em>Bluff</em>, <em>Trash Pushes</em> must be immediately playable and should generally be demonstrated immediately. (This is unlike other similar moves like the <em>5 Pull</em>, which may have to wait a while.)</li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="the-trash-bluff"></a>The Trash Bluff<a class="hash-link" href="#the-trash-bluff" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><ul><li>Normally, when a trash card is clued, it signifies a <em>Trash Chop Move</em> or a <em>Trash Push</em>. However, for both of these strategies to work, it is assumed that the recipient of the clue will know that the card that was touched is useless.</li><li>What if the recipient of the clue does <strong>not</strong> know that the card that the clued card is trash? Then, they will go on to misplay that card, mistaking it for a &quot;normal&quot; <em>Play Clue</em>.</li><li>If players misrepresent the identity of a trash card in this way, it is a signal for the next person to blind-play their <em>Finesse Position</em> card. This is extremely similar to how a <em>Finesse</em> or a <em>Bluff</em> works (e.g. a clued card has been misrepresented as being immediately playable).</li><li><em>Trash Bluffs</em> are a good tool to get a card played that is sitting behind other annoying cards.</li><li>For example, in a 3-player game:<ul><li>On the stacks, all of the 1&#x27;s are played <strong>except</strong> for red 1.</li><li>Cathy has no clued cards in her hand.</li><li>Alice clues Cathy number 1, which only touches her newest (slot 1) card. This card is a blue 1, but Cathy will assume that it is a red 1.</li><li>Bob blind-plays his <em>Finesse Position</em> card, and it is a playable blue 2.</li><li>Cathy now knows that her 1 must not be red 1, or else Bob would not have blind-played anything. The 1 must be some other trash card.</li></ul></li><li>Just like normal <em>Bluffs</em>, <em>Trash Bluffs</em> can only be done while in <em>Bluff Seat</em>.</li><li>Normal <em>Bluffs</em> take precedence over <em>Trash Bluffs</em>. This means that players can <strong>only</strong> use cards to <em>Trash Bluff</em> with if they will be proved to be trash by a blind-play.<ul><li>For example, if not all of the 1&#x27;s have been played on the stacks, then you can use a number 1 clue to initiate a <em>Trash Bluff</em>, because a blind-play will prove that the clued 1 is not a good 1.</li><li>For example, if the red stack is played up to the red 3, then you <strong>cannot</strong> use a red clue to initiate a <em>Trash Bluff</em>, because a blind-play will make the clued card look like the red 5.</li><li>For example, if the red stack is played up to the red 4, then you can use a red clue to initiate a <em>Trash Bluff</em>, because a blind-play will prove that the clued card is not a red 5.</li></ul></li><li>In the case where multiple cards are clued as part of a <em>Trash Bluff</em>, <strong>all</strong> of the touched cards are considered to be trash. However, the focus of the clue should be the first thing discarded, which allows for the possibility of your teammates to give a follow-up <em>Fix Clue</em>.</li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="the-trash-finesse"></a>The Trash Finesse<a class="hash-link" href="#the-trash-finesse" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><ul><li>In a <em>Finesse</em>, we would say that the clue &quot;matches&quot; the blind-play. For example, a blue clue on a blue 2 matches a blind-play of blue 1. Or, a number 2 clue on blue 2 matches a blind-play of blue 1.</li><li>In a <em>Bluff</em>, we would say that the clue does not &quot;match&quot; the blind-play. For example, a blue clue on a blue 2 does not match a blind-play of a red 1. Or, a number 2 clue on a blue 2 does not match the blind-play of a red 2.</li><li>In the <em>Trash Bluff</em> example above, a blue 1 is used to <em>Trash Bluff</em> a blue 2. Similar to a <em>Bluff</em>, we would say this number 1 clue does not match the blind-play of a blue 2.</li><li>What if the <em>Trash Bluff</em> instead got a red 1 to blind-play? In this context, the red 1 would actually &quot;match&quot; the number 1 clue. Another way of saying this is that by cluing the trash 1 with a number 1 clue, the clue giver is saying that they <strong>see</strong> a matching 1 that is good.</li><li>Thus, it is possible to perform a <em>Trash Bluff</em> outside of <em>Bluff Seat</em> if the &quot;matching&quot; card is on someone&#x27;s <em>Finesse Position</em>. When this is done, it promises that someone has that specific card, so we call it a <em>Trash Finesse</em> rather than a <em>Trash Bluff</em>.</li><li>For example, in a 4-player game:<ul><li>All the 1&#x27;s are played on the stacks except for red 1.</li><li>Alice clues number 1 to Donald, which touches a blue 1. To Donald, this will look like it is a red 1.</li><li>At first glance, Bob might think this is a <em>Trash Bluff</em>, causing him to blind-play his <em>Finesse Position</em> card as either red 1 or some other currently-playable card.</li><li>However, Bob also sees that Cathy has a red 1 on her <em>Finesse Position</em>. Thus, Alice&#x27;s clue was a <em>Trash Finesse</em> instead of a <em>Trash Bluff</em>, since it is promises a playable 1.</li><li>Thus, Bob discards.</li><li>Cathy blind-plays her <em>Finesse Position</em> card and it is red 1.</li><li>Donald discards his known-trash 1.</li></ul></li><li><em>Double Trash Finesses</em> are explicitly disallowed. Thus, it is possible to perform a <em>Trash Finesse</em> in a situation like this:<ul><li>All the 1&#x27;s are played on the stacks except for red 1 and blue 1.</li><li>Alice clues number 1 to Donald, which touches two green 1&#x27;s on slot 1 and 2. To Donald, this will look like it is both the red 1 and the blue 1.</li><li>Like in the previous example, Bob sees that Cathy has a red 1 on her <em>Finesse Position</em>.</li><li>At first glance, Bob might think that Alice is promising both red 1 and blue 1, which would mean that he would need to blind-play the blue 1.</li><li>However, a <em>Trash Finesse</em> only promises at least one matching card, and since he sees that Cathy has a matching card, then that is good enough. Thus, Bob discards.</li><li>Cathy blind-plays her <em>Finesse Position</em> card and it is red 1.</li><li>Donald knows that the focus of the clue (slot 1) is certainly trash, since that caused Cathy to blind-play.</li><li>Furthermore, Donald knows that his slot 2 card is also trash, because all the cards touched in a <em>Trash Bluff</em> or <em>Trash Finesse</em> are guaranteed to be trash.</li></ul></li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="the-reverse-trash-finesse"></a>The Reverse Trash Finesse<a class="hash-link" href="#the-reverse-trash-finesse" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><ul><li>First, see the section on the <em><a href="#the-trash-finesse-strong-form">Trash Finesse (Strong Form)</a></em>.</li><li>It is also possible to perform a <em>Trash Finesse</em> in reverse. This is much harder to see than a forward <em>Trash Finesse</em>. Even so, players should generally entertain the possibility of this occurring.</li><li>When a clue looks like it could be a <em>Reverse Trash Finesse</em>, the player who receives the clue is forced into immediately discarding the card. If it was indeed a <em>Reverse Trash Finesse</em>, it will be a trash card and it will immediately demonstrate what is going on. Alternatively, if the clue was a normal <em>Play Clue</em> on a playable card, then the discard will be a <em>Gentleman&#x27;s Discard</em>. By discarding, it covers both cases.</li><li>For example, in 3-player game:<ul><li>The red 1 is played on the stacks. All of the 2&#x27;s are played on the other stacks.</li><li>Alice clues number 2 to Bob, touching his slot 1 card as a <em>Play Clue</em>.</li><li>From Bob&#x27;s perspective, this is probably just a <em>Play Clue</em> on the red 2 (which happens to be the final 2 that needs to be played).</li><li>However, Bob sees that Cathy also has a red 2 on her <em>Finesse Position</em>. That means that this could be a <em>Reverse Trash Finesse</em>.</li><li>If it is a <em>Reverse Trash Finesse</em>, then his 2 is a trash 2 (e.g. green 2). By immediately discarding it, it will prove to Cathy that <em>she</em> has a red 2.</li><li>Alternatively, if Bob does indeed have the red 2, then he can discard it to perform a <em>Gentleman&#x27;s Discard</em> on Cathy.</li><li>Either way, discarding will cover both cases. Bob discards the 2 and it is revealed to be a green 2.</li><li>Cathy comes next. Cathy was highly surprised when Alice gave Bob a number 2 clue on the green 2. From Cathy&#x27;s perspective of Bob&#x27;s perspective, the green 2 clue would immediately misplay as red 2. However, when Bob discards the green 2 instead of playing it, Alice&#x27;s plan becomes clear. Cathy had the red 2 all along. Cathy blind-plays her <em>Finesse Position</em> card as red 2.</li></ul></li><li>Note that <em>Reverse Trash Finesses</em> should not always be entertained and <strong>depend on context</strong>. Specifically, towards the end of the game, <em>Reverse Trash Finesses</em> are &quot;turned off&quot;. This is because towards the end of the game, the team needs tempo, and <em>Reverse Trash Finesses</em> are slow and require even more discarding.</li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="a-trash-flowchart"></a>A Trash Flowchart<a class="hash-link" href="#a-trash-flowchart" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>There are a lot of different moves that involve cluing trash. <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hanabi/hanabi.github.io/main/static/img/flowcharts/cluing_trash_flowchart.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here is a handy flowchart</a> for determining the difference between the different types of special moves that touch trash. (The flowchart contains some strategies that have not been covered yet, but the three most important moves to understand are the <em>Trash Chop Move</em>, the <em>Trash Finesse/Bluff</em>, and the <em>Trash Push</em>.)</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="the-out-of-order-play-clue-triple-o--ooo"></a>The Out-of-Order Play Clue (Triple O / OOO)<a class="hash-link" href="#the-out-of-order-play-clue-triple-o--ooo" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><ul><li>Sometimes, a player will have two playable cards in their hand of the same suit, but they will be &quot;blocked&quot;, meaning that both a color clue and a number clue will not be able to focus the first playable card.</li><li>One technique to get around this is to give a clue that focuses the wrong card, and then have the next player give a <em>Fix Clue</em>. This is called an <em>Out-of-Order Play Clue</em> because the cards were originally out-of-order, but the original focus is still playable.</li><li>For example, in a 3-player game:<ul><li>It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.</li><li>Cathy hand is as follows, from left to right: <code>red 4, red 1, red 2, red 3, blue 4</code></li><li>Alice clues red to Cathy, touching slot 1, slot 2, slot 3, and slot 4.</li><li>Bob sees that Alice has indicated to Cathy that she has the red 1 on slot 1. Cathy will go on to misplay the red 4 as the red 1.</li><li>Normally, Bob would think this is a <em>Finesse</em> and try to play the red 1 into the red 4. However, that doesn&#x27;t make any sense, because Cathy has the red 1, and then Alice would be violating <em>Good Touch Principle</em>.</li><li>Instead, Bob knows that the team should be using Cathy&#x27;s red 1. Thus, Bob knows that he needs to give a <em>Fix Clue</em> to Cathy, because Alice intends for her and Bob to work together.</li><li>Bob clues number 4 to Cathy, touching the blue 4 and &quot;filling in&quot; the red 4.</li><li>Cathy is surprised because the card that she thought was red 1 is actually a red 4. Cathy knows that since the red 4 was the original focus of Alice&#x27;s clue, then it must actually be playable right now. Thus, Cathy must have the red 1, the red 2, and the red 3.</li><li>Cathy plays the red 1 from slot 2 (the left-most red card that could be the red 1). She will go on to play the red 2, the red 3, and the red 4.</li><li>Cathy (and everyone else on the team) knows that even though the blue 4 was the focus of Bob&#x27;s clue, it is not actually playable right now, and was just &quot;collateral damage&quot; of Bob&#x27;s required <em>Fix Clue</em>.</li></ul></li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="the-out-of-order-finesse"></a>The Out-of-Order Finesse<a class="hash-link" href="#the-out-of-order-finesse" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><ul><li>Sometimes, a <em>Finesse</em> is initiated by giving a color clue to two or more cards where the next card in the sequence is clued, but it is <strong>not</strong> the focus of the clue.</li><li>When this happens, the <em>Finesse</em> will still work: a player will blind-play a matching card. However, a <em>Fix Clue</em> must then be given to the player who originally received the clue, or they will go on to misplay.</li><li>Normally, after receiving a <em>Fix Clue</em>, a player would normally &quot;stop&quot; and not assume anything else about his hand. However, this is a special situation: when the original <em>Finesse</em> was given, it was a message that the focus of the clue was playable. <em>Information Lock Principle</em> applies, and it means that the original focus of the clue is also playable.</li><li>For example, in a 3-player game:<ul><li>It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.</li><li>Bob has a red 3 and a red 2 (on slots 1 and 2 respectively).</li><li>Cathy has a red 1 on slot 1 (in <em>Finesse Position</em>).</li><li>Alice clues Bob red (as an <em>Out-of-Order Reverse Finesse</em>). The focus of the clue is the red 3 on slot 1.</li><li>Bob sees the red 1 on Cathy&#x27;s <em>Finesse Position</em>, so he has to respect that it could be <em>Reverse Finesse</em>. Bob discards.</li><li>Cathy blind-plays red 1.</li><li>Alice must now give a <em>Fix Clue</em> to Bob, or else red 3 will be misplayed as red 2.</li><li>Alice clues number 2 to Bob.</li><li>Bob plays red 2.</li><li>Bob knows that his other red card <strong>must</strong> be red 3, since it was originally clued as playable and it caused a <em>Reverse Finesse</em>.</li></ul></li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="the-out-of-order-finesse-interaction-with-5-color-ejection"></a>The Out-of-Order Finesse Interaction with 5 Color Ejection<a class="hash-link" href="#the-out-of-order-finesse-interaction-with-5-color-ejection" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><ul><li>The <em>5 Color Ejection</em> takes precedence over the <em>Out-of-Order Finesse</em> as long as the two-or-more-blind-plays rule is satisfied.</li><li>For example, in a 3-player game, this would be a <em>5 Color Ejection</em>:<ul><li>It is the first turn of the game and nothing is played on the stacks.</li><li>Alice clues red to Cathy, touching a red 5 on slot 1, a red 1 on slot 2, and a red 2 on slot 3.</li><li>Bob knows that this could be an <em>Out-of-Order Finesse</em>. Specifically, if Bob gives a follow-up number 5 <em>Fix Clue</em> to Cathy, then Cathy would play the red 1, Cathy would play the red 2, and Bob would blind-play the red 3, Bob would blind-play the red 4, into Cathy&#x27;s red 5.</li><li>However, this line would require Bob to blind-play 2 cards, so Bob knows that he should prefer a <em>5 Color Ejection</em> instead.</li></ul></li><li>For example, in a 3-player game, this would be an <em>Out-of-Order Finesse</em>:<ul><li>It is the first turn of the game and nothing is played on the stacks.</li><li>Alice clues red to Cathy, touching a red 5 on slot 1, a red 1 on slot 2, a red 2 on slot 3, and a red 4 on slot 4.</li><li>Bob knows that this could be an <em>Out-of-Order Finesse</em>. Specifically, if Bob gives a follow-up number 5 <em>Fix Clue</em> to Cathy, then Cathy would play the red 1, Cathy would play the red 2, Bob would blind-play the red 3, Cathy would play the red 4, and then Cathy would play the red 5.</li><li>Since this line only requires that Bob blind-plays 1 card, he knows that it cannot be a <em>5 Color Ejection</em>, so Bob performs the <em>Fix Clue</em> to allow for the <em>Out-of-Order Finesse</em>.</li></ul></li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="finesses-with-a-lie-component"></a>Finesses with a Lie Component<a class="hash-link" href="#finesses-with-a-lie-component" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><ul><li><em>Lie Principle</em> states all that <em>Fibs</em> must resolve immediately. An untruth that does not resolve immediately is a <em>Lie</em>.</li><li>Normally, <em>Lies</em> are expressly illegal. However, some players will occasionally break the rules for the purposes of getting a <em>Finesse</em>. We call such moves <em>Finesses with a Lie Component</em>.</li><li>Typically, when players <em>Lie</em> out of <em>Bluff Seat</em>, the game quickly falls apart; subsequent clues will have different meanings to different players and everyone will become &quot;desynchronized&quot;. This typically leads to a loss.</li><li>With that said, it is sometimes possible to construct <strong>safe</strong> lines that contain a <em>Lie Component</em>. There is usually deep levels of nuance involved in these lines, so this kind of thing is only recommended for advanced and expert players.</li><li>The previously mentioned <em>Out-of-Order Finesse</em> is a specific example of a <em>Finesse</em> with a <em>Lie Component</em>. One key attribute of the <em>Out-of-Order Finesse</em> is that the player who receives the <em>Fix Clue</em> knows that <strong>all</strong> of the related cards are playable, or it would not have been worth the risk (and the confusion) to perform a line with a <em>Lie Component</em> in the first place.</li><li>This concept can be generalized to all <em>Finesses</em> that have a <em>Lie Component</em>. After a player receives a <em>Fix Clue</em> in such a situation, they should assume that the <em>Finesse</em> is &quot;still on&quot;. So, depending on the situation, they should either know that the initial card that was clued is playable (like in an <em>Out-of-Order Finesse</em>) or continue to blind-play cards to fulfill the initial <em>Finesse</em> (if the card clued with a <em>Fix Clue</em> seems to be unrelated).</li><li>Importantly, <em>Finesses</em> with a <em>Lie Component</em> are <strong>only</strong> allowed if there is not an alternative line that would &quot;get&quot; the same number of cards without any lies. Thus, if you are looking to do a <em>Finesse</em> with a <em>Lie Component</em>, make sure you carefully consider the efficiency of all of the possible alternatives.</li></ul></div></article><div class="margin-vert--xl"><div class="row"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/hanabi/hanabi.github.io/edit/main/docs/level_14.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><svg fill="currentColor" height="1.2em" width="1.2em" preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid meet" role="img" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_2LL7"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div></div></div><div class="margin-vert--lg"><nav class="pagination-nav" aria-label="Blog list page navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/docs/level_13"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Previous</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Â« Level 13 - Senior</div></a></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/docs/level_15"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Next</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Level 15 - Erudite Â»</div></a></div></nav></div></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_2xL- thin-scrollbar"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#the-occupied-play-clue--the-occupied-finesse-opc" class="table-of-contents__link">The Occupied Play Clue &amp; The Occupied Finesse (OPC)</a></li><li><a href="#the-trash-push" class="table-of-contents__link">The Trash Push</a></li><li><a href="#the-trash-bluff" class="table-of-contents__link">The Trash Bluff</a></li><li><a href="#the-trash-finesse" class="table-of-contents__link">The Trash Finesse</a></li><li><a href="#the-reverse-trash-finesse" class="table-of-contents__link">The Reverse Trash Finesse</a></li><li><a href="#a-trash-flowchart" class="table-of-contents__link">A Trash Flowchart</a></li><li><a href="#the-out-of-order-play-clue-triple-o--ooo" class="table-of-contents__link">The Out-of-Order Play Clue (Triple O / OOO)</a></li><li><a href="#the-out-of-order-finesse" class="table-of-contents__link">The Out-of-Order Finesse</a></li><li><a href="#the-out-of-order-finesse-interaction-with-5-color-ejection" class="table-of-contents__link">The Out-of-Order Finesse Interaction with 5 Color Ejection</a></li><li><a href="#finesses-with-a-lie-component" class="table-of-contents__link">Finesses with a Lie Component</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container"><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Built with <a href="https://v2.docusaurus.io/">Docusaurus</a>.</div></div></div></footer></div>
