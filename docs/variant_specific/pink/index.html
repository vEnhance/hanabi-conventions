In other words, the focused card is <em>Promised</em> to match the number of the rank clue.</li><li><em>Pink Promise</em> applies to all clues: <em>Play Clues</em>, <em>Save Clues</em>, <em>5 Stalls</em>, etc.</li><li>For example, in a 3-player game:<ul><li>Cathy has a pink 2 on chop followed by a blue 5.</li><li>Alice and Bob need to give a <em>Save Clue</em> to both the pink 2 and the blue 5.</li><li>If Alice gave a number 5 clue, it would save both of the cards in one fell swoop, since a number 5 clue would touch the pink 2.</li><li>However, doing that would break <em>Pink Promise</em>, since once Cathy learns that her slot 5 card is a pink card, she will always assume that it is a pink 5.</li><li>Thus, Alice gives a number 2 clue as a <em>2 Save</em> on the pink 2, and then Bob clues a number 5 clue as a <em>5 Save</em> on the blue 5.</li></ul></li><li><em>Pink Promise</em> is the <strong>most important</strong> pink convention! If you need to handle a tricky situation with pink cards, then make sure you first satisfy <em>Pink Promise</em> so that it is clear to the team what is going on.</li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="the-1s-assumption"></a>The 1&#x27;s Assumption<a class="hash-link" href="#the-1s-assumption" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><ul><li>Just like in a normal game, when a player gets clued about two or more 1&#x27;s, then they should play all of them in the normal order.</li><li>In other words, even though the non-focused 1&#x27;s <em>could</em> be non-1 pink cards, players are expected to <em>assume</em> that they are real 1&#x27;s.</li><li>This assumption does <strong>not</strong> apply to the other ranks. For example, if all the 1&#x27;s are played on the stacks, and a player has a card in their hand with a single positive number 2 clue on it, then they cannot play the 2, because they might be misplaying a pink 5.</li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="no-order-chop-moves"></a>No Order Chop Moves<a class="hash-link" href="#no-order-chop-moves" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><ul><li>Even though we have the <em>1&#x27;s Assumption</em> convention, it is still possible that a player will give a number 1 clue that touches a bunch of 1&#x27;s and an unplayable pink card.</li><li>In this situation, a <em>Fix Clue</em> will need to be given in the future. (<em>Pink Fix Clues</em> are covered later on.) But the first card that will be played from the clue will always be a real 1.</li><li>Thus, in pink variants, players are not allowed to perform an <em>Order Chop Move</em>, because they could be misplaying a pink card.</li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="good-touch-principle"></a>Good Touch Principle<a class="hash-link" href="#good-touch-principle" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><ul><li>Due to the nature of pink cards being touched by a lot of different kinds of clues, they are a bit easier to duplicate than a normal suit, or even a rainbow suit.</li><li>However, just like any other suit, <em>Good Touch Principle</em> still applies to pink cards. Players should:<ul><li>do their best to not duplicate pink cards</li><li>assume by default that the remaining pink cards in their hand are &quot;good&quot;</li></ul></li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="prompts-with-pink-promise"></a>Prompts with Pink Promise<a class="hash-link" href="#prompts-with-pink-promise" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><ul><li>The <em>Pink Promise</em> convention does <strong>not</strong> change how <em>Prompts</em> work - players are still expected to play the left-most card into a <em>Prompt</em> (or a <em>Priority Prompt</em>), just like they would in any other variant.</li><li>For example, in a 3-player game:<ul><li>Red 1 is played on the stacks.</li><li>Alice clues number 2 to Bob, touching his slot 2, slot, 3 and slot 5. This must be a <em>2 Save</em>.</li><li>Bob marks his slot 5 card as a true 2, because of <em>Pink Promise</em>. The cards on slot 2 and slot 3 could be 2&#x27;s, but are not necessarily 2&#x27;s.</li><li>Later on, Alice clues red to Cathy, touching a red 3 as a <em>Play Clue</em>.</li><li>Bob knows that he is <em>Prompted</em> for the red 2. Bob has three cards in his hand marked with a number 2 clue. Even though Bob knows for sure that slot 5 is a 2, Bob knows that the <em>Prompt</em> simply calls for the left-most card.</li><li>Bob plays the red 2 from slot 2.</li></ul></li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="the-pink-prompt-rank-exception"></a>The Pink Prompt Rank Exception<a class="hash-link" href="#the-pink-prompt-rank-exception" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><ul><li>Normally, <em>Prompts</em> take precedence over <em>Finesses</em>. This means that if a card in a player&#x27;s hand has one or more positive clues on it that &quot;match&quot;, they should never blind-play their <em>Finesse Position</em> and instead play their left-most clued card.</li><li>This rule does <strong>not</strong> apply to potential pink cards that only have a single rank clue on them (and the rank on them does not match the rank of the promised card). In this situation, players should prefer playing their <em>Finesse Position</em> instead of playing the clued card.</li><li>For example, in a 3-player game:<ul><li>All of the 2&#x27;s are played on the stacks.</li><li>Alice clues pink to Cathy, touching a pink 4 on slot 1 as a <em>Play Clue</em>.</li><li>Bob knows that this is either a <em>Prompt</em> or a <em>Finesse</em> on the pink 3.</li><li>Bob&#x27;s slot 2 card and slot 3 card have a single number 4 clue of them (and no other clues). Thus, the pink 3 could technically be Bob&#x27;s slot 2 card.</li><li>Bob knows that <em>Prompts</em> normally take precedence over <em>Finesses</em>. However, Bob also knows that <em>Prompts</em> do not apply to pink cards with a rank mismatch. This is currently the case for him since he is promised a 3 and his clued card has a number 4 clue on it.</li><li>Thus, Bob plays his <em>Finesse Position</em> card as pink 3.</li></ul></li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="remaining-1s-after-all-the-1s-have-been-played"></a>Remaining 1&#x27;s After All the 1&#x27;s Have Been Played<a class="hash-link" href="#remaining-1s-after-all-the-1s-have-been-played" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><ul><li>Often times, in the beginning of the game, a player will receives a number 1 clue that touches a bunch of 1&#x27;s. In these situations, they will play them all from oldest to newest (using the <em>1&#x27;s Assumption</em>).</li><li>If all of the 1&#x27;s have been successfully played on the stacks and a player <em>still</em> has 1&#x27;s remaining in their hand, they should mark them as useful pink cards and hold on to them for later.<ul><li>In other words, they should <strong>not</strong> assume that that they have the next playable pink card (e.g. pink 2).</li></ul></li><li>Later on, if a pink card is <em>Prompted</em> from their hand, the player should play the 1.<ul><li>In other words, the <em>Pink Prompt Rank Exception</em> does not apply to these cards, because they are considered to be &quot;filled-in&quot; as a pink card.</li></ul></li><li>This same concept applies to remaining 2&#x27;s after all of the 2&#x27;s have been played, and so forth.</li></ul><br><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="level-9---violations-of-pink-promise-that-dont-require-a-fix"></a>Level 9 - Violations of <em>Pink Promise</em> That Don&#x27;t Require a Fix<a class="hash-link" href="#level-9---violations-of-pink-promise-that-dont-require-a-fix" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="the-pink-play-clue-lie-with-multiple-1s"></a>The Pink Play Clue Lie (with multiple 1&#x27;s)<a class="hash-link" href="#the-pink-play-clue-lie-with-multiple-1s" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><ul><li>Players can violate <em>Pink Promise</em> with a number 1&#x27;s clue if all of the cards will successfully play.</li><li>For example, in a 3-player game:<ul><li>It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.</li><li>Alice clues number 1 to Bob, touching a red 1 on slot 1, a pink 3 on slot 2, a pink 2 on slot 3, and a pink 1 on slot 4.</li><li>Bob knows that from <em>Good Touch Principle</em> and the <em>1&#x27;s Assumption</em> that all of his 1&#x27;s are good, so he can play all of them from oldest to newest.</li><li>Bob plays the pink 1 from slot 4.</li><li>On his next turn, Bob plays the pink 2 from slot 3. Bob is immediately surprised that this is not a real 1, but he knows that this kind of thing is allowed and that he should continue to play his remaining 1&#x27;s.</li><li>On his next turn, Bob plays the pink 3 from slot 2. Bob is again surprised that this is not a real 1, but he knows that this kind of thing is allowed and that he should continue to play his final 1.</li><li>On his next turn, Bob plays the red 1 from slot 1.</li></ul></li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="the-pink-play-clue-lie-with-a-mismatched-play-clue-that-touches-other-cards"></a>The Pink Play Clue Lie (with a mismatched <em>Play Clue</em> that touches other cards)<a class="hash-link" href="#the-pink-play-clue-lie-with-a-mismatched-play-clue-that-touches-other-cards" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><ul><li>Players can also violate <em>Pink Promise</em> if they are giving a <em>Play Clue</em> and the lie will be resolved when the player who is clued plays their focused card.</li><li>For example, in a 3-player game:<ul><li>Pink 3 and red 2 are played on the stacks.</li><li>Alice clues number 3 to Cathy, touching a pink 4 on slot 1 and a blue 3 on slot 2.</li><li>Bob discards.</li><li>Cathy plays the card on slot 1, thinking that it is a red 3. It is actually the pink 4.</li><li>Cathy knows that Alice broke <em>Pink Promise</em> and that she was lied to, but that it was a <em>Pink Play Clue Lie</em>. Cathy knows that Alice likely did things this way because she wanted a 2-for-1 (to pick up some useful 3 &quot;for free&quot;) instead of just a 1-for-1 on just the pink 4.</li></ul></li></ul><br><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="level-10---pink-fix-clues"></a>Level 10 - Pink Fix Clues<a class="hash-link" href="#level-10---pink-fix-clues" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="the-pink-fix-clue-on-1s"></a>The Pink Fix Clue (on 1&#x27;s)<a class="hash-link" href="#the-pink-fix-clue-on-1s" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><ul><li>Normally, when someone receives a number 1 clue that touches a bunch of 1&#x27;s, they will play all of those 1&#x27;s from oldest to newest.</li><li>If a subsequent clue &quot;fills in&quot; one of the 1s to be a pink card, then the player will <strong>not</strong> play that card anymore (because it could just be any pink card in the game).</li><li>For example, in a 3-player game:<ul><li>Alice clues number 1 to Bob, touching three 1&#x27;s in slot 1, slot 2, and slot 3.</li><li>Bob plays slot 3 and it is a red 1.</li><li>Cathy discards.</li><li>Alice discards.</li><li>Bob plays slot 2, and it is a blue 1.</li><li>Cathy discards.</li><li>Alice clues number 5 to Bob, touching a 5 on his chop as a <em>5 Save</em>.

Bob knows that when 1&#x27;s are filled in to be pink, they should not be played anymore.</li></ul></li><li><em>Pink Fix Clues</em> do not necessarily have to be performed &quot;just in time&quot;. In other words, <strong>any</strong> rank clue that &quot;fills in&quot; a pink card should stop it from being played, even if the clue was early.</li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="the-pink-fix-promise-pfp"></a>The Pink Fix Promise (PFP)<a class="hash-link" href="#the-pink-fix-promise-pfp" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><ul><li>First, see the section on the <em><a href="#the-pink-fix-clue-on-1s">Pink Fix Clue (on 1&#x27;s)</a></em></li><li>Normally, <em>Pink Promise</em> only applies when a pink card is the focus of a clue. However, as an exception, <em>Pink Promise</em> also applies to a <em>Pink Fix Clue</em> that stops a card marked with a number 1 clue from misplaying.</li><li>For example, in a 3-player game:<ul><li>Alice clues number 1 to Bob, touching three 1&#x27;s in slot 1, slot 2, and slot 3.</li><li>Bob plays slot 3 and it is a red 1.</li><li>Cathy discards.</li><li>Alice discards.</li><li>Bob plays slot 2, and it is a blue 1.</li><li>Cathy discards.</li><li>Alice clues number 3 to Bob, touching a 3 on his chop.

The 3 on his chop could be any 3 in the game. Furthermore, Bob knows that <em>Pink Promise</em> applies to this <em>Fix Clue</em> and that his pink card should be a pink 3.</li></ul></li><li>As an exception, <em>Pink Fix Promise</em> does <strong>not</strong> apply when the <em>Fix Clue</em> is a number 2 clue or a number 5 clue and the newly introduced card was on chop. An example of this can be found in the <a href="#the-pink-fix-clue-on-1s">previous section</a>. (In the example in this section, Bob&#x27;s pink card is not necessarily a pink 5; it could be any pink card in the game.)</li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="pink-fix-clues-in-general"></a>Pink Fix Clues (in general)<a class="hash-link" href="#pink-fix-clues-in-general" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><ul><li>Normally, if a clue re-touches pink cards that are known to be pink, it is treated as a <em>Pink Choice Tempo Clue</em> or a <em>Pink Choice Finesse</em>.</li><li>However, what if the indicated slot is not a pink card? That does not make sense, as <em>Pink Choice</em> is typically only used to communicate a play about a pink card.</li><li>In this situation, it must not be a <em>Play Clue</em> at all.

This must be a <em>Bubblegum Finesse</em>, indicating which slot the pink 2 is in.</li><li>Bob sees that Cathy has the pink 2 in slot 4. Thus, he knows that the <em>Bubblegum Finesse</em> is not on him. Bob discards.</li><li>Cathy goes through the same steps as Bob. Cathy does not see the pink 2 anywhere else, so she knows that the <em>Bubblegum Finesse</em> is on her. Cathy blind-plays pink 2 from slot 4.</li><li>Donald knows that since Cathy played his slot 4 card, this was a <em>Bubblegum Finesse</em>, and that his pink card must be the matching card.
