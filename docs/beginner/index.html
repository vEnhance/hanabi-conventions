Here&#x27;s an example of a screenshot using the &quot;BGA-style&quot; card layout:</p><p><img alt="Screenshot" src="/assets/images/screenshot-b9e0e6ff962168dee53eb8966ff7f15d.png"></p><ul><li>The five <strong>play stacks</strong> are on the left.</li><li>The <strong>player hands</strong> are on the right.</li><li>Alice is always player 1. (She will always go first.)</li><li>Bob is always player 2. (He will always go second.)</li><li>Cards are drawn and added to the left side to each hand. Thus, Alice&#x27;s newest card is the blue 1 and Bob&#x27;s newest card is the red 1.</li><li>Conversely, the oldest card is the right-most card. Alice&#x27;s oldest card is the blue 5 and Bob&#x27;s oldest card is the red 5.</li><li>A card&#x27;s <em>slot</em> refers to its position in the hand. In the above screenshot, the blue 1 is on slot 1, the blue 2 is on slot 2, the blue 3 is on slot 3, and so forth. The red 1 is on slot 1, the red 2 is on slot 2, the red 3 is on slot 3, and so forth.</li></ul><p><img alt="Screenshot" src="/assets/images/screenshot2-462777e7acd38da15187cc280385539f.png"></p><ul><li>When a card has one or more clues on it, a yellow border will appear around the card. The blue 1 and the red 1 will now have permanent yellow borders around them (until they are played or discarded).</li><li>The arrows indicate the specific cards that are &quot;touched&quot; by the last clue that was given.</li></ul><br><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="the-basics"></a>The Basics<a class="hash-link" href="#the-basics" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="the-chop"></a>The Chop<a class="hash-link" href="#the-chop" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><ul><li>The right-most unclued card is called the &quot;chop&quot; card. (This is a metaphor of a card being &quot;on the chopping block&quot;.)</li><li>When a player needs to discard, they should discard their chop card.</li><li>This way, everyone discards in a predicable way.</li></ul><p><img alt="Chop" src="/assets/images/chop-4ca71dad124850668dbaee4488c5e951.png"></p><ul><li>In the above screenshot:<ul><li>Alice&#x27;s chop card is the red 5 (on slot 5).</li><li>Bob&#x27;s chop card is the red 3 (on slot 5).</li></ul></li></ul><p><img alt="Chop" src="/assets/images/chop2-85568394a197324fe0c8fad49d4bf16b.png"></p><ul><li>In the above screenshot:<ul><li>Alice&#x27;s chop card is the blue 4 (on slot 4).</li><li>Bob&#x27;s chop card is the blue 4 (on slot 2).</li></ul></li></ul><br><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="single-card-focus"></a>Single Card Focus<a class="hash-link" href="#single-card-focus" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><ul><li>In some Hanabi groups, when a bunch of cards are clued, there is no consistent definition of what you should do.</li><li>In our group, we don&#x27;t want there to be any guesswork - we all agree on a system that specifies <strong>exactly</strong> what a clue means so that everyone is always on the same page.</li></ul><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="the-system"></a>The System<a class="hash-link" href="#the-system" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><ul><li>If two or more cards are touched, then <strong>the clue is only focused on a single card</strong>. (Meaning that it is either a <em>Play Clue</em> or a <em>Save Clue</em> on the focused card only.)</li><li><strong>Nothing is implied about the non-focused cards</strong> (beyond that they will be useful at some point later on).</li><li>So, how do you know which card is focused?<ul><li>The focus is always on the card that did not have any clues on it already. (We refer to this as the &quot;brand new card introduced&quot;.)</li><li>If there are multiple &quot;new&quot; cards, then:<ul><li>If the chop card is a &quot;new&quot; card, then the <strong>focus is on the chop</strong>.</li><li>Otherwise, the <strong>focus is on the left-most card</strong>.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="example-1---a-basic-clue"></a>Example 1 - A Basic Clue<a class="hash-link" href="#example-1---a-basic-clue" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p><img alt="Single Focus" src="/assets/images/single_focus-60abe236743268954f0e55c60cdf0a1c.png"></p><ul><li>If only one card is touched by a clue, then the clue is (obviously) talking about that one card.</li><li>In the above screenshot, Alice clues blue to Bob.</li><li>Thus, the focus of the clue is blue 1. This is a <em>Play Clue</em> on blue 1.</li></ul><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="example-2---left-most-focus"></a>Example 2 - Left-most Focus<a class="hash-link" href="#example-2---left-most-focus" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p><img alt="Single Focus" src="/assets/images/single_focus2-cf2c7e8f9bd8e1a7b1eae31286f0391c.png"></p><ul><li>In the above screenshot, Alice clues blue to Bob.</li><li>Before this clue, Bob&#x27;s hand was completely unclued. So, with this clue, <strong>two new cards were introduced</strong> - the blue card on slot 2 and the blue card on slot 4.</li><li>Bob knows that in this situation, the focus of the clue is the left-most of the two new cards. Thus, similar to the last example, this is a <em>Play Clue</em> on blue 1.</li><li>Since the other blue card in his hand must be useful, Bob can reason that it is either blue 2, blue 3, blue 4, or blue 5. He will hold on to the card for later.</li></ul><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="example-3---chop-focus"></a>Example 3 - Chop Focus<a class="hash-link" href="#example-3---chop-focus" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p><img alt="Single Focus" src="/assets/images/single_focus3-5c7edbaee1b9c0d57076cb3ca8354c63.png"></p><ul><li>In the above screenshot, Alice clues purple to Bob (on the first turn of the game).</li><li>Before this clue, Bob&#x27;s hand was completely unclued. So, with this clue, <strong>three new cards were introduced</strong> - slot 1, slot 2, and slot 5.</li><li>Before this clue, Bob&#x27;s chop was slot 5. So, since the clue touched his chop and <em>Chop Focus</em> has priority, this must be a <em>Chop Focus Play Clue</em> on purple 1. Bob should play the slot 5 card as purple 1.</li></ul><br><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="play-clues--save-clues"></a>Play Clues &amp; Save Clues<a class="hash-link" href="#play-clues--save-clues" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><ul><li>A clue can either be:<ul><li>a <em>Save Clue</em> (meaning to save the focused card for later)</li><li>a <em>Play Clue</em> (meaning to play the focused card)</li></ul></li><li>Let&#x27;s go through each in turn.</li></ul><br><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="save-clues"></a>Save Clues<a class="hash-link" href="#save-clues" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><ul><li><em>Save Clues</em> <strong>can only be given to cards on chop</strong>.
