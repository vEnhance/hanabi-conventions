a few different kinds of <em>Chop Moves</em>. While <em>Chop Moves</em> may not be used in every single game, level 3 players should be comfortable with all of the basic forms.</li><li>Level 3 subsections:<ul><li><a href="#conventions--special-moves">Conventions &amp; Special Moves</a></li><li><a href="#general-principles">General Principles</a></li><li><a href="#common-mistakes">Common Mistakes</a></li></ul></li></ul><br><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="conventions--special-moves"></a>Conventions &amp; Special Moves<a class="hash-link" href="#conventions--special-moves" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="the-sarcastic-discard"></a>The Sarcastic Discard<a class="hash-link" href="#the-sarcastic-discard" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><ul><li>Occasionally, through a mistake (or complicated situation), the same card will be clued in two different people&#x27;s hands. Generally, this is to be avoided, but sometimes it happens. Handling this can be tricky.</li><li>Generally, the <strong>first</strong> player who fully realizes that they have the duplicate card should discard it (as opposed to playing it or holding on to it). This is called a <em>Sarcastic Discard</em>, and it communicates to the other player that they 100% have the discarded card. (This is because normally, from <em>Good Touch Principle</em>, we never discard cards that have been clued, so if a player discards a clued card, something special must be going on.)</li><li>For example, in a 3-player game:<ul><li>On the stacks, red 2 is played.</li><li>Alice has one red 3 clued in his hand with just number 3.</li><li>Alice clues number 3 to Bob, which touches one 3. (This is a mistake, because it might be violating <em>Good Touch Principle</em>.)</li><li>Bob knows that the only playable 3 is red 3. He also knows that Alice has a clued red 3 already in her hand. Thus, he knows that he has the red 3 and that Alice made a mistake.</li><li>Bob performs a <em>Sarcastic Discard</em> to pass the red 3 back to Alice.</li></ul></li><li>The <em>Sarcastic Discard</em> is similar to the <em>Prompt</em>, except that it is initiated by a discard instead of a clue.</li><li>However, unlike a <em>Prompt</em>, if there are multiple cards that a <em>Sarcastic Discard</em> could apply to, then it does <strong>not</strong> promise that it is the left-most card. It only promises that they have the card somewhere. For example:<ul><li>Alice <em>Sarcastic Discards</em> a red 3.</li><li>Bob has two cards clued with number 3 in his hand. He does not have any color information on either 3.</li><li>Bob can be certain that one of the two 3&#x27;s is red 3, but he does not know which one it is yet.</li></ul></li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="playing-multiple-1s---the-fresh-1s-rule-part-2"></a>Playing Multiple 1&#x27;s - The Fresh 1&#x27;s Rule (Part 2)<a class="hash-link" href="#playing-multiple-1s---the-fresh-1s-rule-part-2" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><ul><li>First, see the section on <a href="/docs/level_2#playing-multiple-1s---play-order-inversion-in-the-starting-hand-part-1">Playing Multiple 1&#x27;s - Play Order Inversion in the Starting Hand (Part 1)</a>.</li><li>If two (or more) 1&#x27;s are clued in someone&#x27;s hand, and one of the 1&#x27;s was in the starting hand, and one of the 1&#x27;s was not, then the &quot;fresh&quot; card is probably more important. (Otherwise, the clue might have been given earlier.)</li><li>Thus, freshly drawn 1&#x27;s should always be played before any 1&#x27;s that were present in the starting hand.</li><li>Continuing on from the example in <a href="/docs/level_2#playing-multiple-1s---play-order-inversion-in-the-starting-hand-part-1">Playing Multiple 1&#x27;s - Part 1</a>, imagine that:<ul><li>Bob plays the slot 4 card. (He then draws a card, and all of the other cards in his hand slide over.)</li><li>Alice clues 1&#x27;s to Bob, which touches a brand new card on slot 1 and re-touches the ones on slot 3 and slot 4.</li></ul></li></ul><p><img alt="Playing Multiple 1&amp;#39;s" src="/assets/images/playing_multiple_1s-46882976afe8928433c637ec16415d2f.png"></p><ul><li>Bob knows that fresh 1&#x27;s have precedence, so he plays the slot 1 card next.

However, <em>Chop-Focus</em> overrides this rule, so she knows that the slot 5 card (her chop) should play first.</li><li>After that, she uses the <em>Fresh 1&#x27;s Rule</em>, and knows to play the 1 in slot 1 next.</li><li>After that, she will play the rest of the 1&#x27;s from oldest to newest (since they were in her starting hand), so she will play slot 3 and then slot 2.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="the-chop-move"></a>The Chop Move<a class="hash-link" href="#the-chop-move" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><ul><li>Normally, players discard their oldest (right-most) unclued card. However, sometimes a player can know that an unclued card is very important.</li><li>A <em>Chop Move</em> is a special kind of move that indicates to a player that the unclued card that is currently on their chop is very important.</li><li>After the <em>Chop Move</em>, the player considers the card on their chop to be touched with an &quot;invisible&quot; clue. Thus, their chop will &quot;move&quot; to the next right-most unclued card.</li><li>A <em>Chop Move</em> is permanent, meaning that a <em>Chop Moved</em> card should not be discarded for the remainder of the game.</li><li>Several kinds of <em>Chop Moves</em> are listed below.</li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="the-trash-chop-move"></a>The Trash Chop Move<a class="hash-link" href="#the-trash-chop-move" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><ul><li>See the <em>Chop Move</em> section above for an explanation on what a <em>Chop Move</em> is.</li><li>In the middle of a game, if all of the 1&#x27;s have been played already, and someone clues a 1, this is quite strange. (From <em>Good Touch Principle</em>, players are not supposed to touch cards that have already been played.) In this situation, the 1 is considered &quot;trash&quot;.</li><li>The clue must have some deeper meaning. We agree that it means that the cards to the right of the trash are important. The point of the clue was to give the player a safe discard.</li><li>However, in addition to giving a safe discard, it should also <em>Chop Move</em> <strong>all</strong> of the cards to the right of the trash.</li><li>For example, in a 3-player game:<ul><li>All of the 1&#x27;s are played.</li><li>Bob has a completely unclued hand.</li><li>Alice clues 1&#x27;s to Bob, which touches a 1 in his slot 4.</li><li>Bob <em>Chop Moves</em> his slot 5.</li><li>Bob discards the 1.</li><li>Bob&#x27;s chop is now his slot 4.</li></ul></li><li>Most of the time, the <em>Trash Chop Move</em> is done for a single card (meaning that the trash card that was clued was one-away from chop). However, you can also use the <em>Trash Chop Move</em> to <em>Chop Move</em> multiple cards. For example, in a 3-player game:<ul><li>All of the 1&#x27;s have been played on the stacks.</li><li>Bob has a completely unclued hand.</li><li>Alice clues 1&#x27;s to Bob, which touches a 1 in his slot 1.</li><li>Bob <em>Chop Moves</em> his slot 2, his slot 3, his slot 4, and his slot 5 (a quadruple <em>Chop Move</em>).</li><li>Bob discards the 1.</li><li>Bob&#x27;s chop is now his slot 1.</li></ul></li><li>This move is most commonly done with a number 1 clue because it is likely that in the middle of a game, all of the 1&#x27;s will be already played. But it could also be done with a number two 2 clue if all the 2&#x27;s are already played / accounted for. Or, it could be done with a red clue if all of the red cards are already played / accounted for. And so forth.</li><li>Strategy wise, the <em>Trash Chop Move</em> is used for two main reasons:
1) Sometimes there are multiple critical cards in a row on chop and it falls to one player to save all of them. In this situation, a multiple-card <em>Chop Move</em> could be the only way to do it.
2) Some cards (e.g. a <em>one-away-from-playable</em> 3) are quite useful to the team, but &quot;illegal&quot; to touch directly (as touching them directly with a clue would imply that they are playable right now). If the game is going well, then it can be useful to &quot;waste&quot; a clue in order to have the card saved permanently.</li><li>Note that you are <strong>not</strong> allowed to <em>Trash Chop Move</em> a card that you can just clue directly with a <em>Save Clue</em> (unless there are multiple critical cards in a row on chop and you have no other choice). This is because having some positive information is always better than having the card be a mystery.</li><li>If a <em>Trash Chop Move</em> touches <strong>multiple</strong> trash cards, then it only <em>Chop Moves</em> the cards to the right of the right-most trash card.

Thus, if you clue a 5 and it is <strong>two</strong> (or more) slots away from the chop, then it is to be assumed to be a <em>Play Clue</em> on the 5.<ul><li>When counting how far away from chop a card is, you should only look at <strong>unclued</strong> cards.</li></ul></li><li>Similar to the <em>Trash Chop Move</em>, if a <em>5&#x27;s Chop Move</em> touches <strong>multiple</strong> 5&#x27;s, then it only <em>Chop Moves</em> the cards to the right of the right-most 5. For example, in a 3-player game:<ul><li>All the 1&#x27;s are played on the stacks.</li><li>Bob has a completely unclued hand.</li><li>Alice clues 5&#x27;s to Bob, which touches a 5 in slot 2 and a 5 in slot 4.</li><li>Bob <strong>only</strong> <em>Chop Moves</em> his slot 5 card.

For example, an electron is a type of a particle, and an electron can either be &quot;spin up&quot; or &quot;spin down&quot;. But an electron could also be in a superposition of both &quot;spin up&quot; and &quot;spin down&quot; at the same time, as weird as that sounds. Eventually, if the electron happens to bounces off of something (e.g. is measured), then the superposition will &quot;collapse&quot; and it will <strong>only</strong> be in a &quot;spin up&quot; or &quot;spin down&quot; state. The details of quantum mechanics are not important - the main point is that we treat unknown Hanabi cards sort of like unknown particles: even though they <strong>really</strong> have a true identity, we ignore that and treat them as being all of the possibilities at the same time.</li><li>As soon as a clue is given to a card that could be two or more different things, then the assumed superposition of all of the possibilities is locked in to the card.</li><li>For example, in 3-player rainbow game:<ul><li>It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.</li><li>Alice clues Bob red, touching a red card on slot 1 as a <em>Play Clue</em>.</li><li>Bob immediately right-clicks on the card and writes a note&quot; of &quot;red 1 or rainbow 1&quot;.</li><li>This card is now &quot;locked in&quot; as this specific superposition. Future clues and actions can narrow down the cards in the superposition or completely collapse the superposition, but new cards can never be added to the superposition.</li></ul></li></ul><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="information-lock-on-in-between-cards"></a>Information Lock on In-Between Cards<a class="hash-link" href="#information-lock-on-in-between-cards" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><ul><li>As soon as a clue is given to a card that is not immediately playable, the assumed identity is locked in to the card <strong>and</strong> all of the in-between cards.</li><li>For example, in a 4-player no variant game:<ul><li>Red 1 is played on the stacks.</li><li>Bob has one card in his hand clued with number 2.

(It has no color clues on it.)</li><li>Bob has a written a note of &quot;red 2&quot; on the card, meaning that it has been &quot;locked in&quot; as a red 2. (Bob will permanently think that it is a red 2.)</li><li>Alice clues blue to Bob, which &quot;fills in&quot; the card as a blue 2.</li><li>It is now impossible for this card to be a red 2 - Bob knows that he was lied to earlier on in the game. Bob erases his note of &quot;red 2&quot; on the card and the <em>Information Lock</em> is broken.</li></ul></li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="efficiency"></a>Efficiency<a class="hash-link" href="#efficiency" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><ul><li>A big part of Hanabi is of trying to be as efficient as possible. This means that players will generally try to &quot;get&quot; as many cards with one clue as possible.</li><li>If you use one clue to get one card, we refer to that as a 1-for-1 clue. For example:<ul><li>On the first turn of the game, Alice clues Bob number 1, touching one 1 as a 1-for-1.</li></ul></li><li>If you use one clue to get two cards, we refer to that as a 2-for-1 clue. For example:<ul><li>On the first turn of the game, Alice clues Bob number 1, touching two 1&#x27;s as a 2-for-1. (Bob will play both.)</li></ul></li><li>3-for-1 clues are even better than 2-for-1 clues, and so forth. It is even possible to perform a 9-for-1 clue with advanced techniques.</li><li>If a clue touches two cards but only one of them will play right now, it <strong>still counts</strong> as a 2-for-1. This is because we assume that all touched cards will eventually play from <em>Good Touch Principle</em>. For example:<ul><li>On the first turn of the game, Alice clues Bob red, touching a red 1 on slot 1 and a red 5 on slot 2 as a 2-for-1. (Bob will only play the red 1 and save the other red card for later.)</li></ul></li><li>On Hanab Live, the future required efficiency is shown on the right side of the screen. Future required efficiency is calculated by the following formula:<ul><li><code>number of cards that remain to be clued / number of clues remaining</code></li></ul></li><li><strong>If future required efficiency is high, players should probably not perform 1-for-1 clues!</strong> Instead, it is better to discard and try to let someone perform a <em>Finesse</em>.</li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="tempo"></a>Tempo<a class="hash-link" href="#tempo" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><ul><li><em>Tempo</em> is a term used to describe the speed at which cards are played. (This is similar to how it is used in other games such as chess.)</li><li>Hanabi can be thought of a race to get all the cards played before the time runs out. This means that even if the team is being extremely efficient, they can still lose the game if they are not playing their cards fast enough. Thus, players have to <strong>strike a balance between <em>Efficiency</em> and <em>Tempo</em></strong>. You can think of <em>Efficiency</em> and <em>Tempo</em> as the yin and yang of Hanabi.</li><li>At the beginning of the game, there is a lot of time left, so players will generally prefer clues that get a lot of efficiency over clues that get a lot of tempo.</li><li>At the end of the game, there is almost no time left, so players stop caring about efficiency and start caring only about tempo.</li><li>On Hanab Live, &quot;Pace&quot; is shown at the right side of the screen. Pace is a measure of how many more discards can occur, so this essentially tells you how much time is left in the game. Starting pace is calculated by the following formula:<ul><li><code>current score + cards in deck + number of players - maximum score</code></li></ul></li><li>Even at the beginning of the game, players might prefer a clue that gets tempo over a more efficient clue if it will prevent the discard of some other useful card. It all depends on the context of the game!</li></ul><br><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="common-mistakes"></a>Common Mistakes<a class="hash-link" href="#common-mistakes" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="the-wrong-prompt-mistake"></a>The Wrong Prompt (Mistake)<a class="hash-link" href="#the-wrong-prompt-mistake" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><ul><li>A common mistake in Hanabi is to attempt to perform a <em>Finesse</em> when there is a &quot;matching&quot; card in that player&#x27;s hand. Since <em>Prompts</em> take precedence over <em>Finesses</em>, the player will always play their matching clued cards first.</li><li>When a card is <em>Prompted</em> and it misplays, everyone can read into this mistake - it was almost certainly a <em>Wrong Prompt</em>, meaning that the player who gave the clue probably intended for the <em>Finesse Position</em> card to play instead.</li><li>Thus, if there is nothing else special about the situation, the player who misplayed should go on to play their <em>Finesse Position</em> card on the next turn.</li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="critical-discards-after-a-chop-move-mistake"></a>Critical Discards after a Chop Move (Mistake)<a class="hash-link" href="#critical-discards-after-a-chop-move-mistake" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><ul><li>If a player <em>Chop Moves</em> a card, and then the next time they discard, they discard a critical card, then obviously some kind of mistake occurred.</li><li>The best explanation is that the <em>Chop Move</em> was never intended in the first place.</li><li>Thus, when this happens, the player should &quot;undo&quot; the <em>Chop Move</em>.</li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="undoing-an-accidental-chop-move-mistake"></a>Undoing an Accidental Chop Move (Mistake)<a class="hash-link" href="#undoing-an-accidental-chop-move-mistake" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><ul><li>Often times a player can misinterpret a clue as a <em>Chop Move</em> when it really had some other meaning. If this happens, after they discard their new <em>Chop</em>, everyone else on the team will know that an accidental <em>Chop Move</em> has occurred.</li><li>Later on in the game, sometimes a player in this situation can retroactively realize that they have made a mistake by <em>Chop Moving</em> earlier on. They might be tempted to shift their chop back to where it is supposed to be.</li><li>However, unless they discard a critical card (see the above section), players should generally <strong>not ever undo a <em>Chop Move</em></strong>, because they could be discarding a now-critical card that was not critical at the time of the original mistake. Everyone else on the team did not bother to clue the now-critical card, because they thought it was safely <em>Chop Moved</em>.</li></ul></div></article><div class="margin-vert--xl"><div class="row"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/hanabi/hanabi.github.io/edit/main/docs/level_3.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><svg fill="currentColor" height="1.2em" width="1.2em" preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid meet" role="img" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_2LL7"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div></div></div><div class="margin-vert--lg"><nav class="pagination-nav" aria-label="Blog list page navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/docs/level_2"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Previous</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Â« Level 2 - Novice</div></a></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/docs/level_4"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Next</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Level 4 - Neophyte Â»</div></a></div></nav></div></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_2xL- thin-scrollbar"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#conventions--special-moves" class="table-of-contents__link">Conventions &amp; Special Moves</a><ul><li><a href="#the-sarcastic-discard" class="table-of-contents__link">The Sarcastic Discard</a></li><li><a href="#playing-multiple-1s---the-fresh-1s-rule-part-2" class="table-of-contents__link">Playing Multiple 1&#39;s - The Fresh 1&#39;s Rule (Part 2)</a></li><li><a href="#playing-multiple-1s---the-chop-focus-exception-part-3" class="table-of-contents__link">Playing Multiple 1&#39;s - The Chop Focus Exception (Part 3)</a></li><li><a href="#the-chop-move" class="table-of-contents__link">The Chop Move</a></li><li><a href="#the-trash-chop-move" class="table-of-contents__link">The Trash Chop Move</a></li><li><a href="#the-5s-chop-move-5cm" class="table-of-contents__link">The 5&#39;s Chop Move (5CM)</a></li><li><a href="#chop-moves--new-clues" class="table-of-contents__link">Chop Moves &amp; New Clues</a></li><li><a href="#chop-moves--prompts" class="table-of-contents__link">Chop Moves &amp; Prompts</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#general-principles" class="table-of-contents__link">General Principles</a><ul><li><a href="#information-lock-principle" class="table-of-contents__link">Information Lock Principle</a></li><li><a href="#efficiency" class="table-of-contents__link">Efficiency</a></li><li><a href="#tempo" class="table-of-contents__link">Tempo</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#common-mistakes" class="table-of-contents__link">Common Mistakes</a><ul><li><a href="#the-wrong-prompt-mistake" class="table-of-contents__link">The Wrong Prompt (Mistake)</a></li><li><a href="#critical-discards-after-a-chop-move-mistake" class="table-of-contents__link">Critical Discards after a Chop Move (Mistake)</a></li><li><a href="#undoing-an-accidental-chop-move-mistake" class="table-of-contents__link">Undoing an Accidental Chop Move (Mistake)</a></li></ul></li></ul></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container"><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Built with <a href="https://v2.docusaurus.io/">Docusaurus</a>.</div></div></div></footer></div>
