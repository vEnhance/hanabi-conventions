title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><ul><li>Usually, when a <em>Bluff</em> occurs, the blind-playing player has no idea that is a <em>Bluff</em> - they assume they are playing a specific card into a true <em>Finesse</em>.</li><li>However, in rare situations, a clue will be given that looks like a <em>Finesse</em>, but the next player will know for sure that they do not have the &quot;matching&quot; card.</li><li>In these situations, if the next player cannot see a better explanation for the clue, then they should blind-play their <em>Finesse Position</em> card as a <em>Known Bluff</em>.</li><li>For example:<ul><li>The player might see all of the copies of the card that they are supposed to be blind-playing.</li><li>The player might have negative information on their entire hand (e.g. negative blue on every card when they are supposed to be blind-playing a blue 2).</li><li>The player might know that they are blind-playing a 1 into a <em>3 Bluff</em> (e.g. a card was clued with number 3 and there are no cards played yet).</li></ul></li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="the-hard-bluff"></a>The Hard Bluff<a class="hash-link" href="#the-hard-bluff" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><ul><li>First, see the section on <a href="/docs/level_8#how-to-tell-the-difference-between-a-finesse-and-a-bluff-part-2---bluffs-are-on-mismatched-cards">How to Tell the Difference Between a Finesse and a Bluff (Part 2)</a>.</li><li>Sometimes, it can be ambiguous as to whether a player blind-played a card into a <em>Bluff</em>, or they blind-played into a <em>Finesse</em> + <em>Prompt</em>. In this situation, <em>Occam&#x27;s Razor</em> applies, so players should go with the <em>Bluff</em> interpretation, since it is simpler. When such a <em>Bluff</em> occurs, it is called a <em>Hard Bluff</em> to disambiguate from situations where <em>Bluffs</em> happen with no ambiguity.</li><li>For example, this is a <em>Finesse</em> + <em>Prompt</em> and <strong>not</strong> a <em>Hard Bluff</em>:<ul><li>Only red 1 is played on the stacks.</li><li>Cathy has a 3 clued in her hand (with no color information on it).</li><li>Alice clues Cathy about a brand new 4.</li><li>Bob blind-plays red 2.</li><li>In a normal <em>Bluff</em>, a <em>one-away-from-playable</em> card is clued. However, Cathy sees that the highest stack is the red stack, so the 4 in her hand must be two-away.</li><li>Thus, Cathy does <strong>not</strong> read it as a <em>Bluff</em>; she is promised red 3 and red 4, so she plays the unknown 3 as a <em>Self-Prompt</em> for the red 3.</li></ul></li><li>For example, this <strong>is</strong> a <em>Hard Bluff</em>:<ul><li>Red 1 and blue 2 are played on the stacks.</li><li>Cathy has a 3 clued in her hand (with no color information on it).</li><li>Alice clues Cathy about a brand new 4.</li><li>Bob blind-plays red 2.</li><li>This could be a <em>Bluff</em> if the 4 in her hand is blue 4, since blue 4 is currently <em>one-away-from-playable</em>. Thus, Cathy <strong>does not</strong> assume that her 4 is red 4, and subsequently, <strong>does not</strong> assume that her unknown 3 is a red 3. However, it could <strong>also</strong> be the case that the 4 is a red 4 (if the 3 in her hand happens to be red 3).</li><li>Thus, Cathy marks down both possibilities for later and does not play anything right now.</li></ul></li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="the-hard-3-bluff"></a>The Hard 3 Bluff<a class="hash-link" href="#the-hard-3-bluff" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><ul><li>Players can use a 3 to <em>3 Bluff</em> the 1 of the same suit.</li><li>For example, in a 3-player game:<ul><li>Nothing is played on the stacks.</li><li>Alice clues number 3 to Cathy, touching a red 3 on slot 1 as a <em>Play Clue</em>.</li><li>Bob blind-plays red 1.</li><li>Bob now knows that it was a <em>3 Bluff</em> and that no-one is promised the red 2. This is because even though the red 1 is the same suit as the red 3, <em>3 Bluffs</em> take precedence over <em>Double Finesses</em> as long as the clue type (number 3) does not match the card that was blind-played (a number 1).</li></ul></li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="the-hard-4-double-bluff"></a>The Hard 4 Double Bluff<a class="hash-link" href="#the-hard-4-double-bluff" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><ul><li>Similar to a <em>Hard 3 Bluff</em>, it is also possible to perform a <em>Hard 4 Double Bluff</em>.</li><li>For example, in a 4-player game:<ul><li>No cards are played on the stacks.</li><li>Alice clues number 4 to Donald, touching a red 4 as a <em>Play Clue</em>.</li><li>Bob blind-plays red 1 from his <em>Finesse Position</em>.</li><li>Cathy blind-plays red 2 from her <em>Finesse Position</em>.</li><li>Even though red 1 and red 2 are the same suit as the red 4, the team knows that no-one is promised the red 3.</li></ul></li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="the-hard-5-double-bluff"></a>The Hard 5 Double Bluff<a class="hash-link" href="#the-hard-5-double-bluff" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><ul><li>Similar to a <em>Hard 3 Bluff</em> and a <em>Hard 4 Double Bluff</em>, it is also possible to perform a <em>Hard 5 Double Bluff</em>.</li><li>For example, in a 5-player game:<ul><li>It is the <em>Mid-Game</em> and all the 1&#x27;s are played on the stacks.</li><li>Alice clues number 5 to Emily, touching a red 5 as a <em>Play Clue</em>.</li><li>Bob blind-plays a red 2 from his <em>Finesse Position</em>.</li><li>Cathy blind-plays a red 3 from her <em>Finesse Position</em>.</li><li>Donald sees that no-one else has any red cards in their hand. Thus, if this was a <em>Triple Finesse</em> on the red 5, then Donald should blind-play the red 4 right now.</li><li>However, Donald also knows that 5&#x27;s are valid <em>Double Bluff</em> targets. Since number 3 does not match number 5, Donald knows that he should prefer the <em>Double Bluff</em> interpretation (that gets two blind-plays) over the <em>Triple Finesse</em> interpretation (that gets three blind-plays).</li></ul></li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="self-color-bluffs-1-for-1-form-scb"></a>Self Color Bluffs (1-for-1 Form) (SCB)<a class="hash-link" href="#self-color-bluffs-1-for-1-form-scb" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><ul><li>It is possible (and fairly common) to perform a <em>Self-Bluff</em> on a player with a rank clue.</li><li>For example, in a 3-player game:<ul><li>Red 2 is played on the stacks.</li><li>Alice clues number 4 to Bob, which touches one brand new 4 as a <em>Play Clue</em>.</li><li>Bob does not see any playable cards in anyone else&#x27;s hand.</li><li>The closest 4 to being playable is the red 4, so Bob knows that the 4 in his hand is probably a red 4.</li><li>Since Bob does not see any red 3&#x27;s, Bob knows he must have the red 3, and he blind-plays his <em>Finesse Position</em> card. It is a blue 1 and successfully plays.</li><li>Bob now knows that he was <em>Bluffed</em> by Alice and that the 4 in his hand is exactly red 4.</li></ul></li><li>Doing a <em>Self-Bluff</em> on a player with a color clue is a bit more weird. On the face of it, a <em>Self Color Bluff</em> would be nonsensical, since the receiving player would have negative color on the card that they are blind-playing - they would explicitly know that the blind-card cannot possibly match.</li><li>Nonetheless, we agree that in this situation, players should blind-play a card anyway as a <em>Known Bluff</em>.</li><li>For example, in a 3-player game:<ul><li>Red 2 is played on the stacks.</li><li>Alice clues red to Bob, which &quot;fills in&quot; a card with a number 4 clue on it. It is now a globally-known red 4.</li><li>This must be a <em>Play Clue</em> on the red 4, since Alice is not in a stalling situation. (If Alice was in a stalling situation, then she would be allowed to give a &quot;fill-in&quot; clue without anything special happening.)</li><li>Bob does not see any red cards in other player&#x27;s hands, so it cannot be a <em>Prompt</em> or a <em>Reverse Finesse</em>.</li><li>Bob cannot possibly have the red 3 in his <em>Finesse Position</em>, because that card has negative red.</li><li>Thus, Bob knows that this must be a <em>Self Color Bluff</em>, so he blind-plays his <em>Finesse Position</em> card as a <em>Known Bluff</em> on any playable non-red card. It is a blue 1 and it successfully plays on the stacks.</li></ul></li><li>Note that <em>Self Color Bluffs</em> should not be confused with the more-ordinary &quot;fill-in&quot; clues that are used in stalling situations. (See the <a href="/docs/level_6#allowable-stall-clues-stall-table">Allowable Stall Clues</a> section.) In other words, <strong>if someone could be in a stalling situation, you should never blind-play a card from a fill-in clue</strong>.</li><li><em>Self Color Bluffs</em> are not very good and should only be used sparingly, because:<ul><li>they can be confusing</li><li>they almost always have an efficiency of a 1-for-1</li></ul></li><li>Expert players can use <em>Self Color Bluffs</em> as a nice alternative to giving a 1-for-1 directly to the card in <em>Finesse Position</em>.

This could be because they know the identity of every card in their hand (minus their <em>Finesse Position</em> card). Or, alternatively, they could have relevant negative information on their entire hand.</li><li>If the player can rule out a <em>Layered Finesse</em>, then it is possible to perform a <em>Stacked Bluff</em> on them. It is important to note that such a player is &quot;locked in&quot; to the <em>Bluff</em> and should almost always immediately play their <em>Finesse Position</em> card.</li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="the-known-priority-bluff"></a>The Known Priority Bluff<a class="hash-link" href="#the-known-priority-bluff" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><ul><li>Players generally perform <em>Priority Bluffs</em> by tricking players into thinking they have a specific card. However, it is also possible to perform a <em>Priority Bluff</em> that is globally-known to be a <em>Bluff</em>. For example:<ul><li>Alice has a three known playable cards: red 1, blue 4, and blue 5.</li><li>Bob has a known red 2.</li><li>Alice is expected to play the red 1 into the red 2, so the red 1 has <em>Priority</em>.</li><li>Instead, Alice plays the blue 4.</li><li>Normally, Bob would think that this is a <em>Priority Finesse</em> on the blue 5. However, both he and Alice know that Alice has the blue 5.</li><li>This must be a <em>Known Priority Bluff</em>, so Bob plays his <em>Finesse Position</em> card as any other playable card.</li></ul></li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="the-elimination-bluff--the-elimination-layered-finesse"></a>The Elimination Bluff &amp; The Elimination Layered Finesse<a class="hash-link" href="#the-elimination-bluff--the-elimination-layered-finesse" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><ul><li>Normally, if a player has <em>Elimination Notes</em> on their hand, you can clue the next card in the suit to perform an <em>Elimination Finesse</em>.</li><li>It is also possible to pretend like you are performing an <em>Elimination Finesse</em> on someone in order to get an unrelated card to blind-play from their oldest slot.</li><li>If the player who performed the clue was in <em>Bluff Seat</em>, then it is to be treated like a <em>Bluff</em>, and thus they will not know where the actual <em>Elimination Card</em> is. (However, in most cases, at this point there will only be one remaining card with an <em>Elimination Note</em> on it, so it won&#x27;t matter.)</li><li>If the player who performed the clue was not in <em>Bluff Seat</em>, then the blind-playing player is expected to keep playing until they find the intended card. This is similar to how a <em>Layered Finesse</em> works, but it is inverted such that they play cards from oldest to newest.</li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="the-out-of-position-bluff-oop--the-reverse-bluff"></a>The Out-of-Position Bluff (OOP) / The Reverse Bluff<a class="hash-link" href="#the-out-of-position-bluff-oop--the-reverse-bluff" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><ul><li>It is legal to perform a <em>Reverse Finesse</em>, but it is not legal to perform a <em>Reverse Bluff</em>, because it breaks the <em>Bluff Seat</em> rule (and violates <em>Lie Principle</em>).<ul><li>Why this policy? It is not possible to play with both <em>Layered Finesses</em> and <em>Reverse Bluffs</em> at the same time. <em>Layered Finesses</em> are much better, so we choose to &quot;turn on&quot; <em>Layered Finesse</em> and &quot;turn off&quot; <em>Reverse Bluffs</em>.</li></ul></li><li>However, players <strong>can</strong> rarely break the <em>Bluff Seat</em> rule if <strong>one of the following is true</strong>:<ol><li>The next player is at 0 clues (and won&#x27;t blind-play anything / will blind-play an unrelated card).</li><li>The next player will think that they have the <em>Bluffed</em> card in their own hand and will not try to <em>Finesse</em> or <em>Bluff</em> the next player. (In this case, the <em>Bluffed</em> card means the card that will blind-play.)</li><li>The next player has enough positive or negative clues on their entire hand to know that they cannot have the card that the blind-played card will be played as.</li></ol></li><li>Essentially, if i. or ii. is true, then the next player cannot act on their state of misinformation. And if iii. is true, then the next player will have full knowledge that a <em>Lie</em> is occurring, so they will not try to &quot;get&quot; the <em>Bluffed</em> card.</li><li>Since valid <em>Out-of-Position Bluffs</em> are so rare, it is important to remember that:<ul><li>Valid <em>Out-of-Position Bluffs</em> take precedence over <em>Known Bluffs</em>. In other words, if Bob can see that an <em>OOP Bluff</em> could be valid (meaning it meets one of the three criteria above), then Bob should not blind-play anything as a <em>Known Bluff</em> and let Cathy play instead.</li><li>Valid <em>Out-of-Position Bluffs</em> take precedence over <em>Layered Finesses</em>. In other words, if Cathy can see that an <em>OOP Bluff</em> could be valid (meaning it meets one of the three criteria above), then Cathy should not continue to blind-play cards as a <em>Layered Finesse</em>.

Thus, this must be a <em>Bad Touch Double Finesse</em>, so Donald discards his red 3 as a <em>Sarcastic Discard</em> to pass it back to Emily.</li><li>Emily plays the red 3.</li></ul></li><li>More examples of a <em>Bad Touch Double Bluff</em> can be found <a href="/docs/examples/bad_touch_double_bluff">here</a>.</li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="the-pestilent-triple-bluff"></a>The Pestilent Triple Bluff<a class="hash-link" href="#the-pestilent-triple-bluff" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><ul><li>First, see the section on the <em><a href="/docs/level_17#the-pestilent-double-bluff-pdb">Pestilent Double Bluff</a></em>.</li><li>Rarely, it is possible that a <em>Pestilent</em>-style clues is performed with a two-away-from-playable card instead of a <em>one-away-from-playable</em> card. In this situation, it would transform into a <em>Triple Bluff</em> instead of a <em>Double Bluff</em>.</li><li>Note that normally, <em>Triple Bluffs</em> are explicitly illegal.

Thus, Alice&#x27;s clue is quite strange.</li><li>Alice must be intending for Donald to also blind-play his <em>Finesse Position</em> in order to &quot;heal&quot; the problem. Donald blind-plays his <em>Finesse Position</em>. It is a green 2 and it successfully plays.</li><li>At first, Emily thought that her 4 was the blue 4, in order to match the blue 2 and the blue 3. However, if that was the case, then Donald would not have blind-played anything.

However, if a player intentionally tries to make a <em>Hesitation Blind-Play</em> occur, it is called a <em>Pass Bluff</em>.</li><li>In other words, after a <em>Finesse</em> occurs that is directed at you, you will know that your <em>Finesse Position</em> card is playable. If the next immediate player also has an unrelated playable card on their <em>Finesse Position</em>, you can pretend like the <em>Finesse</em> wasn&#x27;t directed at you. This will cause them to think that the <em>Finesse</em> was directed at them, and you will get the unrelated card played for free.</li><li>After the unrelated card is played, the next player should <strong>not</strong> continue to blind-play cards (as a <em>Layered Finesse</em>) because:<ul><li>The &quot;passing&quot; player fulfills the real <em>Finesse</em> on their next turn.</li><li>The &quot;passing&quot; player was in <em>Bluff Seat</em>.</li></ul></li><li><em>Pass Bluffs</em> rely on contextual information in order to work, so the circumstances in which you can do them are narrow.</li><li>It is illegal for a player to perform a <em>Pass Bluff</em> if they could be <em>Bluffed</em>.

In this situation, players will normally try to perform a <em>Layered Finesse</em> in order to get all of the cards in the most efficient manner. However, a <em>Layered Finesse</em> may not always be available.</li><li>In extremely rare situations, it is possible to orchestrate a <em>Lie</em> in which the player with the fully playable hand thinks that they are <em>Layered Finessed</em> when they really do not have the connecting card. After they play their final card and it is not the matching card, they will know that they were <em>Purge Bluffed</em> and that nobody has the missing card.</li><li>Care has to be taken that the other player (e.g. the player who is not <em>Purge Bluffed</em>) will understand what is going on.
