class="hash-link" href="#the-selfish-clue" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><ul><li>A <em>Selfish Clue</em> is when a player:
1) has a playable card in their hand (e.g. red 2)
2) gives a <em>Play Clue</em> to the next connecting card (e.g. red 3)</li><li>In almost all cases, there is no reason to give a <em>Selfish Clue</em>. Players can simply play their playable card and let someone else on the team &quot;get&quot; the next card. Being <em>Selfish</em> is typically associated with having bad teamwork.</li><li>However, in rare cases, giving a <em>Selfish Clue</em> can be good.</li><li>For example, in a 3-player game:<ul><li>All the 1&#x27;s are played on the stacks.</li><li>Alice has a globally-known playable red 2 in her hand.</li><li>Bob hand is as follows, from newest to oldest: <code>blue 1, red 3, red 4, red 5, blue 1</code></li><li>Both Bob and Cathy has a safe discard.</li><li>Alice knows that on this turn, she is expected to play the red 2, unless she has a really good clue to give.</li><li>Alice sees that if she plays the red 2, then Bob will probably have nothing to do, and will go on to discard the blue 1.</li><li>At that point, the red 5 will be on chop, and it will be difficult for the team to get all of the red cards. Specifically, someone will probably have to give a number 3 clue to Bob as a 1-for-1 on the red 3.</li><li>Alice sees that if she gives a red clue to Bob <em>right now</em> (e.g. before she plays the red 2), then she will be able to &quot;lock-in&quot; a nice 3-for-1 clue. Even though the team will lose <em>Tempo</em>, this will be inconsequential because Bob has a safe discard and Cathy has a safe discard.</li><li>Alice clues red to Bob as a <em>Selfish Play Clue</em>.</li></ul></li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="trash-touch-elimination"></a>Trash Touch Elimination<a class="hash-link" href="#trash-touch-elimination" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><ul><li>After deciding on the target of a clue, players carefully choose between using a color clue and a number clue in order to avoid violating <em>Good Touch Principle</em> with the ancillary cards that will be touched (since every clued card is treated as a card that will eventually be played). Sometimes, when both a color clue <strong>and</strong> a number would violate <em>Good Touch Principle</em>, players are forced to pick between the lesser of two evils.</li><li>However, sometimes you can see that it <strong>is</strong> possible to use a color or number clue to uniquely touch a clue target without &quot;picking up&quot; extra bad cards. So, when extra bad cards are deliberately touched in this way, it is conveying an extra special message.</li><li>When this occurs and there is exactly one &quot;missing&quot; card, players should write an <em>Elimination Note</em> in their hand for the missing card. This is called <em>Trash Touch Elimination</em>.</li><li>For example, in a 3-player game:<ul><li>Red 3 is played on the stacks. All of the other suits have the 1 played on the stacks.</li><li>Bob&#x27;s hand is, from newest to oldest: red 4, red 1, blue 1, green 1, yellow 1.</li><li>Alice wants to give a play clue to the red 4. Everyone else on the team (other than Bob) can see that she can give either number 4 or red.<ul><li>If Alice clues number 4, then it will uniquely touch the red 4 (which will satisfy <em>Good Touch Principle</em>).</li><li>If Alice clues red, then it will touch the red 4 and the red 1 (which will <strong>violate</strong> <em>Good Touch Principle</em>).</li></ul></li><li>Alice clues red to Bob. Since nothing was stopping her from cluing number 4, this is very strange.</li><li>Bob plays the red 4.</li><li>There is only one &quot;missing&quot; red card - the red 5. Cathy knows that normally, Bob would think that his red 1 is the red 5 (from <em>Good Touch Principle</em>). This must mean that Cathy has the red 5. Cathy writes <em>Trash Touch Elimination Notes</em> on her hand for the red 5.</li></ul></li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="the-hesitation-blind-play"></a>The Hesitation Blind-Play<a class="hash-link" href="#the-hesitation-blind-play" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><ul><li>Sometimes, a player will receive a <em>Play Clue</em> on a card. And then, instead of playing it, they will discard their chop instead. This would normally indicate some sort of emergency. However, sometimes it can be seen that there is nothing special going on and that everybody has safe chop cards.</li><li>In such a situation, if the player is not making a mistake, the only reason that they would discard is that they are allowing for the possibility of a <em>Prompt</em> or a <em>Reverse Finesse</em> - someone else on the team has a playable card (either clued or on <em>Finesse Position</em>) that &quot;matches&quot; the card that they got the <em>Play Clue</em> on.</li><li>Depending on the game state, clever players may be able to blind-play their <em>Finesse Position</em> card in response to this hesitation, getting a card for &quot;free&quot;. This kind of move is called a <em>Hesitation Blind-Play</em>.</li><li>For example, in a 3-player game:<ul><li>Red 1 and all of the other 2&#x27;s are played on the stacks.</li><li>The team has 5 clues. Nobody on the team has any cards clued in their hand.</li><li>Alice clues number 3 to Bob, touching a blue 3 on slot 1 as a <em>Play Clue</em>. (The team is now at 4 clues.)</li><li>Bob discards. (The team is now at 5 clues.)</li><li>From Cathy&#x27;s perspective, Bob was supposed to play the blue 3 immediately instead of discarding.</li><li>Cathy knows that since the team has so many clues available, this cannot be a <em>Scream Discard</em> from Bob. (<em>Scream Discards</em> are only typically done when the team is at 0 or 1 clues.)</li><li>Thus, Cathy knows that Bob must be hesitating because is he allowing for the possibility of a <em>Reverse Finesse</em>. In this situation, the only possible card that could Bob could be hesitating for is red 2.</li><li>Cathy blind-plays her <em>Finesse Position</em> card. It is red 2 and it successfully plays.</li><li>Alice discards.</li><li>Bob knows that since Cathy blind-played the red 2, Alice did a <em>Reverse Finesse</em> and that he has the red 3.</li><li>Bob plays the 3, but it is revealed to be blue 3 instead of red 3.</li><li>Bob now knows that nobody has the red 3 and that Cathy blind-played the red 2 from Bob&#x27;s hesitation.</li></ul></li><li><em>Hesitation Blind-Plays</em> are <strong>not always safe</strong> to do:<ul><li>If a player could be hesitating for a clued card in your hand <strong>or</strong> your <em>Finesse Position</em> card, then you cannot act on the hesitation. (If you guess wrong, you could misplay a critical card.)</li><li>If a player could be hesitating for a card that is identical to the card that was clued, then you cannot act on the hesitation. (If you blind-play the same copy of the card, then they will go on to misplay the clued card.)</li><li>If blind-playing a particular card would cause the original clue to look like a <em>Double Finesse</em> with a &quot;self&quot; component, then you cannot act on the hesitation. (For example, if a number 4 clue causes a <em>Hesitation Blind-Play</em> of a red 2, the clue receiver would go on to misplay their <em>Finesse Position</em> card as the red 3.)</li></ul></li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="the-hesitation-chop-move-from-a-misplay"></a>The Hesitation Chop Move (From a Misplay)<a class="hash-link" href="#the-hesitation-chop-move-from-a-misplay" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><ul><li>Remember that as a special exception, <em>Scream Discards</em> do <strong>not</strong> apply when a player has a &quot;blind&quot; card to play in their hand <strong>and</strong> the blind card can exist in your hand.</li><li>Thus, when this occurs, you will usually want to blind-play your <em>Finesse Position</em> card, since this sequence of events indicates either an <em>Ambiguous Finesse</em> or a <em>Pass Bluff</em>.</li><li>When you blind-play a card in this situation and it misplays, it means that the unusual discard really was a <em>Scream Discard</em> after all, so you should treat it like a normal <em>Scream Discard</em> and permanently <em>Chop Move</em>.</li><li>This is called a <em>Hesitation Chop Move</em> for short, since it was triggered by a (failed) <em>Hesitation Blind-Play</em>.</li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="double-prompts-in-multi-color-variants"></a>Double Prompts in Multi-Color Variants<a class="hash-link" href="#double-prompts-in-multi-color-variants" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><ul><li>Normally, when a multi-color card is <em>Prompted</em> from someone&#x27;s hand, they should play the card that has the most positive information.</li><li>However, what if they are <em>Prompted</em> for two cards of the same multi-color suit? They should play the card with the most positive information first, even if it is not the left-most card.</li><li>For example, in a 3-player rainbow game:<ul><li>Rainbow 1 is played on the stacks.</li><li>Bob has a slot 1 card that has a blue clue on it. (Thus, it is either a blue card or a rainbow card.)</li><li>Bob also has a slot 3 card that has a blue clue and a red clue on it. (Thus, it is a known rainbow card.)</li><li>Alice clues Cathy about a rainbow 4.</li><li>Bob is promised the rainbow 2 and the rainbow 3, so he knows that these cards must be on slots 1 and slot 3.</li><li>However, Bob also knows that you should always play the card with the most information on it first, so he plays his slot 3 card as rainbow 2 (instead of slot 1, the left-most card).</li></ul></li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="the-inverted-5s-tempo-clue"></a>The Inverted 5&#x27;s Tempo Clue<a class="hash-link" href="#the-inverted-5s-tempo-clue" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><ul><li>Normally, if a color clue &quot;fills in&quot; a 5 (that was previously touched), and the clue touches no other cards in the hand, then it is obviously focused on the 5 - the 5 is playable right now.</li><li>However, as a special exception, if doing so makes <em>another</em> 5 in that player&#x27;s hand known to be playable, then the clue is said to be focused on the other 5, making the original card clued <strong>not</strong> playable right now.</li><li>Since <em>Inverted 5&#x27;s Tempo Clues</em> only get one card played, they are also <em>Tempo Clue Chop Moves</em> like any other <em>Tempo Clue</em>.</li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="double-tempo-clue-inversion-immediate-double-clue"></a>Double Tempo Clue Inversion (Immediate Double Clue)<a class="hash-link" href="#double-tempo-clue-inversion-immediate-double-clue" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><ul><li>If a player is clued the exact same thing twice before it gets to be their turn, it means that they can play <strong>all</strong> of the cards that the clue touched, but in the opposite order than normal (right-to-left, since you would normally play cards from left-to-right).<ul><li>If one of the cards includes the chop card, it means to play all of the cards from 2nd oldest to newest, and then the chop last.</li></ul></li><li>If you are re-clued about a bunch of cards after you have already taken a turn, see the <em>Double Tempo Clue</em> section.</li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="the-elimination-rewrite-for-1s"></a>The Elimination Rewrite (For 1&#x27;s)<a class="hash-link" href="#the-elimination-rewrite-for-1s" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><ul><li>Normally, when a playable card is discarded, a player will write <em>Elimination Notes</em> on their hand for the other copy of the card.</li><li>However, there is a special case when <strong>two</strong> copies of the same 1 are discarded. The original <em>Elimination Notes</em> from the discard of the first 1 no longer apply because it is possible that the player has drawn the third copy of the 1 before the second copy could be clued.</li><li>Thus, when a player discards the second copy of a playable 1, they should delete all of their <em>Elimination Notes</em> from the first discard and rewrite all of the <em>Elimination Notes</em> on the rest of their hand anew (essentially acting like the second discard was the first discard).</li><li>For example, in a 3-player game:<ul><li>Nothing is played on the stacks.</li><li>Alice discards a red 1. Alice writes <em>Elimination Notes</em> on her slot 2, slot 3, slot 4, and slot 5.</li><li>On her next turn, Alice discards an unrelated card.

This follows from <em>Information Lock Principle</em>. <em>Play Clues</em> given in this manner are called <em>Continuation Clues</em>.</li><li>Because <em>Continuation Clues</em> are the default interpretation, it can be difficult to give a <em>Fix Clue</em>, since a <em>Fix Clue</em> must <strong>only</strong> touch cards inside of the layer.</li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="the-just-in-time-fix-clue-to-fix-a-layered-finesse-with-a-lie-component-jit"></a>The Just-In-Time Fix Clue (To Fix a Layered Finesse with a Lie Component) (JIT)<a class="hash-link" href="#the-just-in-time-fix-clue-to-fix-a-layered-finesse-with-a-lie-component-jit" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><ul><li>When performing a <em>Layered Finesse</em> with a <em>Lie Component</em>, if the plan is to give a <em>Fix Clue</em> to the <em>Finesse Target</em> card (the &quot;final&quot; card that is to be blind-played), then it is important to wait until the <strong>last</strong> moment to give the <em>Fix Clue</em>. This is because after receiving the <em>Fix Clue</em>, the player will not play any more blind cards.</li><li>Thus, you should first wait for all of the &quot;good&quot; blind cards to play, and <strong>then</strong> give the <em>Fix Clue</em> to the <em>Finesse Target</em>, so that it comes &quot;just in time&quot; before the misplay.</li><li>Alternatively, if the plan is to give a <em>Fix Clue</em> to some <strong>other</strong> card than the <em>Finesse Target</em> (e.g. a number 5 clue to a 5 in the middle of the hand), then the <em>Fix Clue</em> does not necessarily have to be just in time. It can be done early, and the player will know that they have to continue blind-playing cards until they find the <em>Finesse Target</em>.</li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="the-negative-blind-play"></a>The Negative Blind-Play<a class="hash-link" href="#the-negative-blind-play" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><ul><li>Given enough negative clues on a card (and potentially some ancillary information based on the history of the game), it is possible to narrow down the identity of an unclued card in your hand to possibilities that only include playable cards that are not already touched in someone else&#x27;s hand.</li><li>In this situation, you are expected to blind-play the card.</li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="the-negative-self-chop-move"></a>The Negative Self-Chop Move<a class="hash-link" href="#the-negative-self-chop-move" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><ul><li>If a card has negative 1, 2, 3, and 4 on it, then it is explicitly known to be a 5, while not directly clued.</li><li>In this situation, it would be a waste of a clue for the team to clue it directly.</li><li>Thus, the player should self-chop move the card.</li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="the-speed-up-clue"></a>The Speed-Up Clue<a class="hash-link" href="#the-speed-up-clue" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><ul><li>The <em>Layered Finesse</em> convention (and its derivatives) are very efficient (in terms of &quot;X for 1&quot;). However, sometimes it can be very slow (low tempo), as players will have to allow for all possible <em>Reverse Finesses</em> before playing anything. This is generally not a problem in 3-player games, but tempo is important in 5-player games.</li><li>Normally, when the <em>Finesse Target</em> (the card that is to be blind-played) is clued directly, it is a mistake due to someone not paying close enough attention. We refer to this as <em>Stomping on a Finesse</em>.</li><li>However, if high tempo is needed, a player can consider intentionally <em>stomping</em> on a <em>Layered Finesse</em> in order to &quot;speed up&quot; the play of a specific card that leads into other players hands.</li><li>One complicating factor of the <em>Speed-up Clue</em> is how to differentiate it from a more-ordinary <em>Fix Clue</em>. In other words, after the clued card is played, on their next turn, should the player go back and blind-play the other cards? If it was a <em>Speed-up Clue</em>, they should. If it was a <em>Fix Clue</em>, they should not.</li><li>The key lies in the context of the clue:<ul><li>Would another player have tried to blind-play something before the potential <em>Fix Clue</em> was given? If yes, then it is not a <em>Fix Clue</em>, and it is a <em>Speed-up Clue</em>.</li><li>Was it possible to take an equivalent line where a <em>Fix Clue</em> would not be needed? (In terms of the same number of clues, and no risk of discarding critical/playable cards.) If yes, it is not a <em>Speed-up Clue</em>.</li></ul></li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="the-layered-jump"></a>The Layered Jump<a class="hash-link" href="#the-layered-jump" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><ul><li>If a player who is blind-playing into a <em>Layered Finesse</em> skips over a card, they are performing a <em>Layered Jump</em>. This player has deduced that the card they are skipping over is duplicated (or otherwise bad).</li><li>The card skipped over in this way will be the next thing discarded, as it is now considered known trash.</li><li>If a <em>Layered Jump</em> skips over a card that cannot be in your own hand, then you can determine that it must be a mistake. In this situation, the skipped-over card must be clued directly to re-signify that it is good.</li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="the-certain-discard-duplication-promise"></a>The Certain Discard Duplication Promise<a class="hash-link" href="#the-certain-discard-duplication-promise" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><ul><li>As the recipient of a <em>Finesse</em>, you are promised a card that you have to blind-play. However, as long as it is not a <em>Certain Finesse</em>, you <strong>have</strong> to account for the possibility of a <em>Layered Finesse</em>. This means that you can never blind-discard the promised card to perform a <em>Gentleman&#x27;s Discard</em>, for example.</li><li>After the <em>Finesse</em> has occurred, but before the promised card has been blind-played, there is a window where a teammate might find strategic value in duplicating the promised card in someone else&#x27;s hand.</li><li>Unless the duplication was a last-resort, if the teammate duplicates the blind card, it <strong>promises</strong> that the duplicated card is on <em>Finesse Position</em> (and there is <strong>no</strong> <em>Layered Finesse</em>), which allows the recipient of the <em>Finesse</em> to blind-discard that card, similar to a <em>Certain Discard</em>.</li><li>Finally, from the perspective of the player receiving the clue, if they end up playing the duplicated card first, then they should know that the focus of the original clue was on the other, non-duplicated card, and they can play it immediately afterwards. (Otherwise, the original clue would be fairly low-value.)</li><li>Note that as long as the duplication clue touches two or more cards, the <em>Certain Discard Duplication Promise</em> interpretation takes priority over the <em>Unknown Trash Discharge</em> interpretation. (<em>Discharge</em> is an advanced move that is covered later on.)</li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="the-certain-finesse-clandestine-exception"></a>The Certain Finesse Clandestine Exception<a class="hash-link" href="#the-certain-finesse-clandestine-exception" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><ul><li>This section outlines a specific and rare edge-case for <em>Certain Finesses</em>.</li><li>We agree that <em>Bluffs</em> take precedence over <em>Certain Finesses</em>. This means that a <em>Certain Finesse</em> cannot normally be performed from <em>Bluff Seat</em>.</li><li><em>Certain Finesses</em> <strong>can</strong> be performed from <em>Bluff Seat</em> if it is strictly impossible to be a <em>Bluff</em>. In other words, this means that it is illegal for a player to perform a <em>Clandestine Finesse</em> on the very next player that targets a potentially duplicated card <strong>and</strong> the other player can rule out the possibility of a <em>Bluff</em>.</li><li>For example, in a 3-player game:<ul><li>All of the 2&#x27;s &amp; blue 3 is played on the stacks. Green 3 is in the discard pile.</li><li>Alice has an unknown 3 in her hand that happens to be the red 3.</li><li>Alice clues number 4 to Cathy, touching a red 4 as a <em>Play Clue</em>.</li><li>Bob knows that Alice could be trying to perform a <em>Finesse</em> on a red 3. Normally, he would blind-discard his <em>Finesse Position</em> card as a <em>Certain Discard</em> in order to pass this card back to Alice.</li><li>However, Bob also knows that this might be a <em>Bluff</em>. But wait - his <em>Finesse Position</em> card has negative blue on it. So anything that he blind-plays here would have to be a 3. Thus, this cannot be a <em>Bluff</em>, since a 3 would match a 4 and look like a <em>Finesse</em>.</li><li>The only other possibility that Bob has to worry about is a <em>Clandestine Finesse</em>. For example, he could be blind-playing a green 3 <strong>and then</strong> a red 3 after that. If he blind-discarded, that could &quot;kill&quot; the green stack, since the other copy of green 3 is already discarded.</li><li>However, Bob <strong>also</strong> knows that you are not allowed to perform a <em>Clandestine Finesse</em> from <em>Bluff Seat</em> that could duplicate a card in your hand. Thus, he can discount both the possibility of a <em>Bluff</em> <strong>and</strong> the possibility of a <em>Clandestine Finesse</em>.</li><li>Bob performs a <em>Certain Discard</em> on his <em>Finesse Position</em> card and it is the red 3, successfully passing it back to Alice.</li></ul></li><li>If someone performs a <em>Certain Discard</em> and you have two or more clued cards that could be the target, then you are not promised the order, only that you have the card clued somewhere in your hand. (This part works in the exact same way as a more-ordinary <em>Sarcastic Discard</em>.)</li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="selfish-focus-inversion-sfi"></a>Selfish Focus Inversion (SFI)<a class="hash-link" href="#selfish-focus-inversion-sfi" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><ul><li>First, see the section on the <em><a href="#the-selfish-clue">Selfish Clue</a></em>.</li><li>Normally, when a player gives a <em>Selfish Clue</em>, they are doing it because no-one else on the team can perform the clue and they want to &quot;lock-in&quot; the value.</li><li>However, if a player gives a <em>Selfish Clue</em> with a color, and that clue could have been easily given by someone else on the team, then that is quite strange. They must be trying to send a deeper message.</li><li>In this situation, they are trying to communicate that the focus of the clue should be inverted. The <em>Play Clue</em> is either on the left-most card (if it would normally be <em>Chop Focus</em>) or on the right-most card (if it would normally be the left-most card).</li><li><em>Selfish Focus Inversion</em> can <strong>only</strong> be performed with color clues.</li><li><em>Selfish Focus Inversion</em> takes precedence over an <em>Out-of-Order Finesse</em>. (This follows from <em>Occam&#x27;s Razor</em>; if it could just be a normal <em>Focus Inversion</em> play clue, then it does not necessarily promise any blind-plays.)</li><li>For example, in a 4-player game:<ul><li>It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.</li><li>Alice clues red to Cathy, touching a red 1 as a <em>Play Clue</em>.</li><li>Bob clues blue to Alice as a <em>Play Clue</em> on a blue 1.</li><li>Instead of playing her red 1, Cathy clues red to Donald, touching a red 3 on slot 1 and a red 2 on slot 2. This must be a <em>Play Clue</em>, since these cards are not on Donald&#x27;s chop.</li><li>Donald knows that since Cathy is not playing her red 1 and giving a clue, she must have a good reason.</li><li>Donald looks around the table and does not see the red 2 in anybody else&#x27;s <em>Finesse Position</em>. Thus, this cannot be a <em>Selfish Finesse</em>.</li><li>Donald also knows that this cannot be a <em>Self Finesse</em>. (Donald has a negative red clue on his <em>Finesse Position</em> card.)</li><li>Thus, this must be a <em>Selfish Focus Inversion</em>, so Donald marks his right-most card as red 2 for later. The other red card in his hand can be red 3, red 4, or red 5. Donald discards.</li></ul></li><li>Note that <em>Selfish Focus Inversion</em> is not allowed in variants with a rainbow or prism suit. In that case, the player is simply giving a play clue to a rainbow/prism card.</li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="the-blaze-discard-a-gentlemans-discard-or-baton-discard-that-promises-the-wrong-slot"></a>The Blaze Discard (A Gentleman&#x27;s Discard or Baton Discard That Promises the Wrong Slot)<a class="hash-link" href="#the-blaze-discard-a-gentlemans-discard-or-baton-discard-that-promises-the-wrong-slot" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><ul><li>Normally, if a player performs a <em>Gentleman&#x27;s Discard</em> and the other card is <strong>not</strong> on <em>Finesse Position</em>, it could one of two things:
1) If the card on <em>Finesse Position</em> is itself playable right now, then it would be a <em>Layered Gentleman&#x27;s Discard</em>.
2) If the card on <em>Finesse Position</em> is not playable right now, then it is an emergency situation or a player is making a mistake.</li><li>Alternatively, if a player performs a <em>Baton Discard</em> and the other card is <strong>not</strong> on <em>Finesse Position</em>, then it is an emergency situation or a player is making a mistake.</li><li>If this is the case, and it is <strong>not</strong> an emergency situation and the player is <strong>not</strong> making a mistake, then the player who is performing the weird <em>Gentleman&#x27;s Discard</em> (or <em>Baton Discard</em>) must be trying to communicate something extra.</li><li>In this situation, the discarding player intends for the very next player to blind-play the <em>Finesse Position</em> that <strong>matches the true <em>Finesse Position</em></strong> of the other card. This is called a <em>Blaze Discard</em> because it &quot;ignites&quot; the next player&#x27;s hand to fix the problem.</li><li>For example, in a 3-player game:<ul><li>All 1&#x27;s are played on the stacks.</li><li>Alice discards a known red 2 as a <em>Gentleman&#x27;s Discard</em>.</li><li>Bob sees that Cathy&#x27;s hand is completely unclued and is as follows, from left to right: <code>red 1 (trash), red 2, green 1 (trash), green 1 (trash), blue 1 (trash)</code></li><li>Bob knows that normally, the <em>Gentleman&#x27;s Discard</em> promises that the other copy of the red 2 is on <em>Finesse Position</em>. But Alice is <em>Lying</em> to Cathy, because she will go on to misplay the red 1 as the red 2.</li><li>Bob knows that it would be pointless for Alice to perform a <em>Gentleman&#x27;s Discard</em> and then for Bob to give a <em>Fix Clue</em>, as that would waste a clue. So, if Alice is not making a mistake, she must be trying to communicate something extra.</li><li>Bob knows that this must be a <em>Blaze Discard</em> and he must blind-play the <em>Finesse Position</em> that matches the <em>Finesse Position</em> of the other card. In this case, since the red 2 is on Cathy&#x27;s <em>Second Finesse Position</em> (slot 2), Bob must play his <em>Second Finesse Position</em> (slot 2).</li><li>Bob blind-plays slot 2. It is a blue 2 and it successfully plays.</li><li>From Cathy&#x27;s perspective, she first suspects that some kind of <em>Ejection</em> is going on, since Bob blind-played his <em>Second Finesse Position</em>. However, since the previous action was a <em>Gentleman&#x27;s Discard</em>, Alice knows that this must be a <em>Blaze Discard</em>. In other words, Bob was just blind-playing his <em>Second Finesse Position</em> to communicate to Cathy that she should play her <em>Second Finesse Position</em> instead of her <em>First Finesse Position</em>.</li><li>Cathy blind-plays the red 2 from slot 2.</li></ul></li><li><em>Blaze Discards</em> do not apply when someone discards a 1 and there are two copies remaining. (In other words, it is still possible to perform a normal <em>Gentleman&#x27;s Discard</em> by discarding a red 1 in the case where Bob has a red 1 on his <em>Finesse Position</em> and Cathy has a red 1 on her <em>Second Finesse Position</em> behind an unplayable card.)</li><li><em>Blaze Discards</em> do not apply when someone performs a <em>Gentleman&#x27;s Discard</em> or a <em>Baton Discard</em> that looks like a <em>Sarcastic Discard</em>. In these situations, one of the following is true:<ul><li>The discarding player is making a mistake (as a <em>Wrong Prompt</em>).</li><li>The discarding player is not making a mistake and there is enough past context for the player with the cards to be able to tell the difference.</li></ul></li><li>Remember that <em>Blaze Discards</em> work with <em>Finesse Positions</em>, <strong>not</strong> with slot numbers.</li><li>For example, in a 3-player game:<ul><li>Alice discards a red 3 as a <em>Blaze Discard</em>.</li><li>Bob sees that Cathy has the other copy of the red 3. However, it is on slot 2 instead of on slot 1. (Cathy&#x27;s hand is completely unclued.) Thus, Bob has to communicate to Cathy that it is actually on her <em>Second Finesse Position</em>.</li><li>Bob has a clued 5 on his slot 1. Thus, Bob&#x27;s <em>Finesse Position</em> is on slot 2 and his <em>Second Finesse Position</em> is on slot 3.</li><li>Bob blind-plays his <em>Second Finesse Position</em> (slot 3). It is a blue 1 and it successfully plays.</li><li>Cathy knows that because Bob blind-played his slot 3, the red 3 must be on her slot 2.</li></ul></li><li>Note that it is illegal to perform an <em>Ambiguous Blaze Discard</em>.
